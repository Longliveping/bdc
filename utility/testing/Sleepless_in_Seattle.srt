the luckiest man-man-man

146
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,360
最幸运的人人人
on the face-face-face of the earth-earth-earth.

147
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,440
那是电影里卢·格里克的台词
The Lou Gehrig line from...

148
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,440
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}美国著名棒球运动员  罹患渐冻症

149
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,330
记得吗  爸爸  这是那部电影里卢·格里克的台词
Remember, Dad, the Lou Gehrig line from...

150
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,790
-《扬基的骄傲》  -《扬基的骄傲》
- Pride of the Yankees. - Pride of the Yankees.

151
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,790
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}《扬基的骄傲》为卢·格里克的传记片

152
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,280
-《扬基的骄傲》  -没错
- Pride of the Yankees! - Yeah. Yeah.

153
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,290
棒球  是关于棒球的玩笑  历史典故
Baseball. It's baseball. Historical reference.

154
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,800
我想请大家举杯
I would like to propose a toast.

155
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,310
-来吧  来吧  -来吧  来吧
- Hear, hear. - Hear, hear.

156
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,790
敬我的妹妹
To my kid sister.

157
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,250
敬沃尔特和我的宝贝女儿
To Walter and my baby.

158
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,000
敬沃尔特和安妮
To Walter and Annie.

159
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,390
各位快吃吧  免得饭菜凉了
Everyone, please eat before it gets cold.

160
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,680
找到了
Here it is.

161
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,780
历史协会一直想要这个
The Historical Society wanted this

162
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,610
我才不会给他们
and I never would give it to them.

163
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,820
妈妈...
Oh, Mum...

164
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,320
我注意到现在流行复古风
I noticed these things are back in fashion.

165
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,780
外婆的婚纱
Grandmother's dress.

166
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,090
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

167
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,450
他是个不错的小伙子  安妮
He's a lovely man, Annie.

168
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,660
我也觉得  他很棒  不是吗
I know, he is wonderful, isn't he?

169
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,090
-他还是个很出色的运动员  -他家人待你好吗
- And he's such a wonderful athlete. - Are his folks nice?

170
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,960
你会喜欢他们的
You'll love them.

171
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,760
我们今晚要去华盛顿跟他们共度圣诞清晨
We're going down to DC tonight to be with them Christmas morning.

172
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,420
-你们是怎么认识的  -其实挺傻的
- How did it happen? - Well, it's silly, really.

173
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,180
我在办公室见过他
I mean, I'd seen him at the office.

174
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,090
我当然见过他  他是副出版人
Obviously I'd seen him. He's the associate publisher.

175
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,940
然后有一天  我们都点了同一家店的三明治
And then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place

176
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,480
他拿了我的生菜番茄全麦三明治
and he got my lettuce and tomato on whole wheat,

177
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,350
当然  他对麸皮过敏
which, of course, he was allergic to.

178
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,690
我拿了他的生菜番茄白面包三明治
And I got his lettuce and tomato on white.

179
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,200
-真不可思议  -是啊
- How amazing. - It is, isn't it?

180
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,410
你做了无数个无意义的决定
You make a million decisions that mean nothing

181
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,240
然后有天你点了份外卖  却因此改变了命运
and then one day you order takeout that changes your life.

182
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,360
命中注定啊
Destiny takes a hand.

183
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,170
妈妈  命运只是我们编来自欺欺人的东西
Mum, destiny is something we've invented

184
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,460
因为我们无法忍受
because we can't stand the fact

185
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,000
凡事皆为偶然的事实
that everything that happens is accidental.

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,090
那你要怎么解释
Then how do you explain

187
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,670
你们俩点了一模一样的口味
that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich

188
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,080
只有面包不同的三明治
except for the bread?

189
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,130
这世界上有多少人
How many people in this world

190
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,840
喜欢只放生菜和番茄的三明治
like lettuce and tomato

191
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,460
而不是再加点别的东西  比如金枪鱼呢
without something else, like tuna?

192
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,930
这也算不上命运的预兆  不过是巧合罢了
Well, it wasn't a sign. It was a coincidence.

193
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,430
我当时和我的家人在大西洋城  克里夫是服务员
I was in Atlantic City with my family, Cliff was a waiter.

194
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,100
他那晚本来不该上班的  
He wasn't even supposed to work that night.

195
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,850
想想看他要真没来会怎样呢
Suppose he hadn't?

196
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,270
他邀请我去钢铁码头午夜漫步
He asked me to take a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.

197
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,570
这故事我大概跟你说了很多遍了吧  但我不在乎
I probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.

198
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,780
然后他牵了我的手
Then he held my hand.

199
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,870
有那么一刻我向下望去
At one point I looked down

200
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,410
我都分不清哪根是他的手指  哪根是我的
and I couldn't tell which fingers were his and which were mine.

201
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,660
我当时就知道
And I knew.

202
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,250
知道什么
What?

203
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,670
你知道的
You know.

204
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,920
知道什么
What?

205
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,800
魔法  那是魔法
Magic. It was magic.

206
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,220
魔法
Magic.

207
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,510
我知道我们会永远在一起
I knew we'd be together forever.

208
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,680
我知道一切都会无比美妙
And that everything would be wonderful.

209
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,100
正如你对沃尔特的感觉
Just the way you feel about Walter.

210
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,230
沃尔特  这名字真正式  不是吗
Walter. It's quite a formal name, isn't it?

211
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,700
我确切知道的事情之一
One of the things I truly knew

212
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,920
就是你爸爸和我
was that your father and I were going to

213
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,110
会很"性"福  你们是这么说的吧
have a wonderful time in the sack, I believe you call it.

214
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,580
妈
Mum.

215
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,670
不过确实要花上几年
Of course it took several years before everything

216
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,840
那方面才会和谐
worked like clockwork in that department.

217
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,920
所以如果暂时默契不够  不必担心
So don't be worried if it takes a while.

218
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,920
-我们已经...  -好吧好吧  你们怎么样
- We already... - Fine, fine. Fiddly-dee. How's it working?

219
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,840
很和谐了
Like clockwork.

220
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,880
亲爱的...
Oh, honey...

221
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,510
-这是个预兆  -你不相信预兆的
- It's a sign. - You don't believe in signs.

222
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,320
他们很喜欢你  我说了他们会喜欢你的
They loved you. I told you they would love you,

223
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,610
果不其然吧
and they loved you.

224
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,020
我爱你
I love you.

225
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,860
我爱你  沃尔特
I love you, Walter.

226
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,820
每个人都叫你沃尔特吗  没有别的昵称吗
Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?

227
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,280
没有
No.

228
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,330
你小时候也没有小名吗
Not even when you were young?

229
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,790
没有  小时候也没有
No, not even when I was young.

230
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,010
你确定我们俩要各自开车吗
You sure you don't want to drive with me?

231
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,630
不然我周五怎么赶回巴尔的摩
Oh, how will I get back to Baltimore on Friday?

232
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,260
我把礼物忘了  沃尔特
I forgot the present. Walter,

233
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,340
我不小心把给你继母准备的礼物忘在里面了
I left your stepmother's present inside by accident.

234
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,060
我发誓  等我老了  头发白了
I swear, when we're old and grey

235
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,940
你得提醒我把假牙戴上
you gonna have to remind me to put my teeth in.

236
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,560
否则我会瘪着嘴满城跑
I'll be walking all over town smacking my gums together,

237
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,810
丝毫没注意自己没戴假牙
not even noticing.

238
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,440
我等你
I'll wait.

239
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,600
你要等我吗  对了
You'll wait? Oh, right.

240
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,900
不  不必等我  沃尔特
No, don't wait, Walter.

241
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,030
真的  这太蠢了  你先走吧
Really, it's silly, you go ahead.

242
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,780
反正我们也迟到了
We're late anyway.

243
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,480
我大概就比你晚到十分钟
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

今晚  我们来聊聊愿望与梦想
Tonight we're talking about wishes and dreams.

268
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,370
你在这个平安夜许下了什么愿望
What's your wish this Christmas Eve?

269
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,700
你的愿望是什么  我的愿望就是换台

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,970
倒放版《铃儿响叮当》
"Jingle Bells" backwards,

277
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,250
演唱者是新泽西的凯特·梅耶兹
sung by the New Jersey Kate Mayze.

278
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,940
来自西雅图的听众  说吧
Seattle, go ahead.

279
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,130
你好  我是乔纳...
Hello, this is Jonah...

280
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,220
不要把姓说出来  乔纳
No last names, Jonah.

281
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,010
你的声音听起来比我们一般的来电听众要年轻
You sound younger than our usual callers.

282
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,090
你多大了
How old are you?

283
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,640
我八岁了
I'm 8.

284
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,680
八岁吗  怎么这么晚还不睡觉
Eight? How come you're up so late?

285
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,480
西雅图还没那么晚
It's not that late in Seattle.

286
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,480
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}芝加哥的时间比西雅图早两小时

287
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,560
当然了  你说得没错
Oh, of course, you're absolutely right.

288
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,600
好了  你的圣诞愿望是什么  乔纳
All right, what's your Christmas wish, Jonah?

289
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,650
这个愿望不是为我自己许的  是为了我爸爸
It's not for me, it's for my dad.

290
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,360
我觉得他需要一个新妻子
I think he needs a new wife.

291
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,620
你不喜欢他现在的妻子吗
You don't like the one he has now?

292
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,330
他现在没有妻子  这就是问题所在
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.

293
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,530
你妈妈呢
Where's your mum?

294
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,820
她去世了
She died.

295
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,780
-我很遗憾  -真是难以置信
- Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. - Well, who can believe this?

296
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,790
我很难过  但我觉得我爸爸更伤心
I've been pretty sad, but I think my Dad's worse.

297
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,080
你跟你爸爸聊过这事吗
Have you talked to your dad about this?

298
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,420
-没有  -为什么呢
- No. - Why not?

299
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,430
这样好像会让他更伤心
It's like it makes him sadder.

300
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,300
我可以理解
I can understand that.

301
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,130
乔纳  你爸爸现在在家吗
Jonah, is your dad home right now?

302
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,890
-在的  -他在干什么  他忙吗
- Yeah. - What's he doing? Is he busy?

303
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,800
不忙吧  他在外面的露天平台上
Not really, he's out on the deck.

304
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,520
我相信我可以帮到他
I'm sure that I can help.

305
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,090
但我需要你的协助
But I'm gonna need you to help me to help him.

306
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,470
-这个坏女人  -所以我希望你做的就是
- Wretched woman! - So what I want you do

307
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,000
-把你爸爸带到电话前  -快挂电话  乔纳  
- is bring your dad to the phone. - Hang up, Jonah!

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,760
别听她的
Don't listen to her.

309
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,810
不可能  他会杀了我的
No way, he'd kill me.

310
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,030
相信我  乔纳
Trust me, Jonah.

311
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,200
当他发现你有多担心他时  他不会生气的
He won't be angry when he realises how concerned you are about him.

312
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,100
-想赌一把吗  -好吧  但如果我被骂了
- Wanna bet? - Okay, but if I get yelled at,

313
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,960
我就再也没法听你的节目了
I'm never gonna listen to your show again.

314
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,660
好吧  有道理
Okay, fair enough.

315
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,410
-爸爸  -怎么了
- Dad? - Yeah.

316
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,710
有人打电话找你
There's someone on the phone for you.

317
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,420
-他叫萨姆  -萨姆
- His name is Sam. - Sam.

318
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,720
如果您刚开始收听  我是玛夏·菲尔斯通医生
If you've just tuned in, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone

319
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,180
今晚的主题是你的愿望和梦想
and tonight's topic is your wishes and dreams.

320
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:16,770
我来接吧
Okay, I got it.

321
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,470
我们现在正在和某位西雅图的听众连线
We're on the line now with someone from Seattle.

322
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,610
你好
Hello.

323
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,600
你好  萨姆  我是美国电台的菲尔斯通医生
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Fieldstone on Network America.

324
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,030
好吧  今晚你要推销什么
Okay. What are you selling tonight?

325
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,860
微波烤肉炉还是日本银座刀
The micro-hibachis or the Ginza knives?

326
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,240
不  我不是来推销的  我只想帮忙
No, I'm not selling anything. I just wanna help.

327
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,200
我想让你知道你儿子打来了电话
I want you to know that your son called

328
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,910
他向我咨询如何才能让你另觅新欢
and he asked me for some advice on how you might find a new wife.

329
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,280
你是哪位
Who is this?

330
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,710
美国电台的玛夏·菲尔斯通医生
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.

331
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,300
我们正在直播
And you are on the air.

332
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,720
你给电台打电话了
You called a radio station?

333
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,680
萨姆  萨姆  萨姆  你在听吗
Sam, Sam, Sam, are you with me?

334
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,210
在的  在听
Yeah. Yes.

335
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,470
你儿子觉得自从你妻子过世后
Your son feels that since your wife's death

336
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,930
你一直都很不开心
you've been very, very unhappy.

337
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,850
他真的很担心你
And he is genuinely worried about you.

338
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,940
过来  过来
Get out here. Get out here.

339
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,190
快点  我才不要一个人接这通电话
Come on, now, I'm not gonna go through this alone.

340
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,400
我认为对他来说  跟你谈论这件事非常艰难
I think it's very hard for him to talk to you about all this.

341
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,980
我想也许你和我可以谈谈
I thought maybe you and I could talk,

342
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,450
这会让乔纳心里更好受一些  萨姆
it would make Jonah feel a little better. Sam?

343
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,710
跟她谈谈吧  爸爸  她是个医生
Talk to her, Dad. She's a doctor.

344
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,240
哪方面的医生
Of what?

345
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,200
万一她名字就叫医生呢
Her first name could be Doctor.

346
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,490
拜托嘛
Please.

347
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,910
萨姆  这是他的圣诞愿望
Sam. Sam, it's his Christmas wish.

348
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,500
-好吧  -很好
- Okay. - Okay. Good.

349
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,420
我知道这不容易
Now, I know this is difficult.

350
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,670
不过尊夫人是多久前去世的
But how long ago did your wife die?

351
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,090
大概一年半前
About a year and a half ago.

352
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,090
从那以后你谈过恋爱吗
Have you had any relationships since?

353
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,640
-没有  -没有吗  为什么
- No. - No? Why not?

354
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,140
玛夏  还是我该叫你菲尔斯通医生
Marcia, or should I call you Dr. Fieldstone?

355
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,490
叫我玛夏医生好了
Dr. Marcia.

356
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,950
-玛夏医生  -玛夏医生  我无意冒犯
- Dr. Marcia. - Dr. Marcia. I don't mean to be rude...

357
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,530
我也不想侵犯你的个人隐私
And I don't want to invade your privacy...

358
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,700
-你明明太想了  -你明明太想了
- Sure you do. - Sure you do.

359
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,960
继续说吧  萨姆  我在听
Go on, Sam. I'm listening.

360
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,870
萨姆
Sam.

361
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,580
一开始的日子很煎熬
We had a pretty tough time there at first.

362
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,960
但我们在慢慢接受
But we're dealing with it.

363
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,220
乔纳和我会好好生活下去
And Jonah and I will get along just fine again,

364
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,760
等我砸了他的收音机就行
as soon as I break his radio.

365
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,860
毫无疑问  你是个好爸爸
I have no doubt that you're a wonderful father.

366
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,490
其实  从一个人的声音里可以听出很多东西
You know, you can tell a lot from a person's voice.

367
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,700
确实如此
You certainly can.

368
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,280
但如果乔纳仍觉得你闷闷不乐
But something must be missing

369
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,360
那你心里一定还残缺着什么
if Jonah still feels that you're under a cloud.

370
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,360
我就问你几个问题  你晚上能入睡吗
Just a few questions: Are you sleeping at night?

371
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,700
他完全睡不着
He doesn't sleep at all.

372
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,740
-你怎么知道  -我住在这里  爸爸
- How do you know that? - I live here, Dad.

373
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,290
圣诞节快到了
Look, it's Christmas.

374
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,170
玛姬  我妻子
Maggie, my wife.

375
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,930
她真的...
She really did it...

376
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,440
我是说  她很喜欢...
I mean, she loved...

377
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,680
她让一切都如此美好
She made everything beautiful.

378
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,740
因此每年的圣诞都会很难熬
It's just tough this time of year.

379
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,190
哪个孩子不需要妈妈呢
Every kid needs a mother.

380
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,730
有没有可能你和乔纳一样  都需要某人的陪伴
Could it be that you need someone just as much as Jonah does?

381
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,460
-是的  -不必回答
- Yes. - Don't answer that.

382
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,500
等听完听众反馈后我们再继续
Let's get into that right after these messages.

383
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,000
萨姆  乔纳  不要挂断
Sam, Jonah, don't go away.

384
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,500
如果您刚开始收听
If you've have just tuned in,

385
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,380
我们正在跟一位来自西雅图的夜未眠先生连线
we are talking to Sleepless in Seattle.

386
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,880
我们将倾听一些听众反馈 休息之后马上回来
And we'll be right back after this break with your listener response.

387
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,510
她在说什么
What is she talking about?

388
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,140
这时候其他人可以打电话进来
This is when other people get to call in

389
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,840
评论你刚刚说的话
and dump on what you said.

390
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,970
这还挺有意思  也挺有帮助
Well, this is really fun. And helpful.

391
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:55,190
{\an8}首都餐厅

392
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,440
我敢说他人又高  屁股又翘
I bet he's tall with a cute butt.

393
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,910
我敢说他好几周都没洗澡  身上臭得要命
I bet he hasn't bathed in weeks and he stinks.

394
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,390
哈莉叶  闭嘴吧  您好  您要点什么
Harriet, shut up. Hi, can I help you?

395
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,740
给我一杯茶  不要茶包
Tea, with the bag out.

396
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,410
也许我该直接去西雅图
You know, maybe I'll just hustle myself up to Seattle,

397
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,250
送他一个除夕夜的小礼物
give him a little gift for New Year's Eve.

398
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,170
随你  你要去就去吧
Yeah, you go on out there if you want to.

399
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,250
但别打开他的冰箱
But don't open his refrigerator.

400
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,260
他们把东西放进冰箱时什么都不盖
They don't cover anything when they put it in the fridge

401
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,630
他们只是把东西放在里面  然后离开
they just stick it in there and leave it

402
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,670
直到东西自己走出去
till it walks out by itself.

403
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,510
我的意思是  就算他在我床上吃零食
All I'm saying is I wouldn't kick this guy

404
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,930
我也不会把他踹下去
out of my bed for eating crackers.

405
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,140
你懂我意思吧  65美分
You know what I'm saying? Sixty five cents.

406
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,260
在接回西雅图之前  让我们来接听一通电话
Let's take a call before we get back to Sleepless.

407
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,600
来自田纳西州诺克斯维尔的这位听众  请说吧
Knoxville, Tennessee, you are on the air. Talk to me.

408
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,980
好的  我只是想知道
Yes, I would just like to know

409
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,230
我从哪里可以得知这位先生的住址
where I could get this man's address.

410
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,140
亲爱的  先去排队吧
Honey, get in line.

411
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,610
下一位听众  请讲
Next caller, go ahead.

412
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,490
请允许我问一个问题...
If there was one question I was allowed to ask...

413
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,200
问吧
Oh, go ahead.

414
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,620
真正爱过的人  更有可能再次陷入爱河
People who truly loved once are far more likely to love again.

415
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,880
萨姆  你觉得你还能像爱你妻子一样
Sam, do you think that there is someone out there you could love

416
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,410
爱另一个人吗
as much as your wife?

417
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,880
玛夏·菲尔斯通医生  这很难想象
Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone, that's hard to imagine.

418
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,210
那你打算怎么办
What are you going to do?

419
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,890
我打算每天早上起床
Well, I'm going to get out of bed every morning

420
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,140
一整天都保持呼吸
and breathe in and out all day long.

421
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,900
一段时间过后  我就不必再提醒自己
And after a while I won't have to remind myself

422
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,810
每天早上要起床  要保持呼吸
to get out of bed every morning and breathe in and out.

423
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,080
再过一段时间  我就不会再想着
And then after a while I won't have to think about

424
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,910
我也曾拥有过一段精彩而完美的人生
how I had it great and perfect for a while.

425
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,830
萨姆  告诉我你的妻子究竟有何特别之处
Sam, tell me what was so special about your wife.

426
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,120
你的节目有多长时间
Well, how long is your programme?

427
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:45,220
其实是无数件小事
Well, it was a million tiny, little things.

428
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,970
当这些小事积少成多
When you added them all up,

429
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,880
这就意味着我们注定在一起
it just meant we were supposed to be together.

430
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,390
我知道
And I knew it,

431
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,390
当我第一次触碰她时我就知道了
I knew it the very first time I touched her.

432
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,830
感觉就像回家
It was like coming home,

433
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,480
我不曾知晓的那个家
only to no home I'd ever known.

434
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,020
我当时只是牵着她的手
I was just taking her hand

435
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,000
扶她下车
to help her out of a car.

436
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,240
于是我就知道了
And I knew it.

437
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,340
那感觉就像...
It was like...

438
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,390
-魔法  -魔法
- Magic. - Magic.

439
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,130
听众朋友们  节目是时候结束了
Well, folks, it's time to wrap it up.

440
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,840
我是芝加哥的玛夏·菲尔斯通医生
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone in Chicago.

441
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,300
祝各位听众朋友们度过一个魔法般的美妙圣诞
And to all my listeners, a magical and merry Christmas.

442
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,430
至于你  这位来自西雅图的夜未眠先生
And to you, Sleepless in Seattle,

443
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,720
我们希望你能尽快再次来电  让我们知晓后续
we hope you'll call again soon and let us know how it's going.

444
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:40,020
{\an9}♪你将在那里找到我♪
♪ It's where you find me ♪

445
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,310
那是一定的
Oh, you can count on it.

446
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:50,360
{\an9}♪我知道在彩虹之上♪
♪ I know somewhere over the rainbow ♪

447
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,950
{\an9}♪有蓝鸟飞翔♪
♪ The blue birds fly ♪

448
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,710
{\an9}♪蓝鸟飞翔♪
♪ Birds fly ♪

449
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,090
{\an9}♪飞翔在彩虹之上♪
♪ Over the rainbow ♪

450
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:18,770
{\an9}♪那么为何  为何我不能飞翔♪
♪ Why then, oh why can't I? ♪

451
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,530
{\an8}巴尔的摩太阳报报社

452
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,570
这家伙卖的汤一定是你喝过的最好喝的
This man sells the greatest soup you've ever eaten,

453
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,940
却又是全美国最刻薄的人
and he is the meanest man in America.

454
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,570
我有强烈的预感  贝琪  不仅仅是汤
I feel very strongly about this, Becky. It's not just about soup.

455
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,750
写吧  还有什么素材吗
Do it. What else?

456
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,290
除夕  拜托别让我写这个主题
New Year's Eve. Please don't make me write it.

457
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,280
听听这个
Listen to this:

458
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,840
"大芝加哥地区的通讯于平安夜
"Phone service in the greater Chicago area was tied up

459
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,170
中断两小时
for two hours Christmas Eve

460
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,220
只因某个孩子给电台节目打电话
when some kid calls a phone in radio show

461
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,420
说他爸爸需要一位新妻子"
and says that his dad needs a new wife."

462
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,420
两千名女性打电话给电台
Two thousand women called the station

463
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,880
索要那位先生的电话号码
asking for the guy's number.

464
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,190
-天哪  -我听到了
- Jesus. - I heard it.

465
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,850
那孩子来电说  "我爸爸需要一位妻子"
This kid calls up and says, "My dad needs a wife."

466
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,640
那个心理医生几乎是逼他来接电话  然后说
And the shrink head practically forces the guy on the phone and says,

467
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,690
"你想聊聊这事吗"
"Do you want to talk about it? "

468
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,100
他说  "不  其实我不想"
And he says, "No, as a matter of fact, I don't."

469
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,950
然后突然间  毫无缘由地
And then suddenly for no reason at all

470
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,820
他就开始说他有多爱他妻子
he start to talk about how much he loved his wife

471
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,530
他是如何爱上了她
and how he just fell in love with her

472
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,610
就好像他是密歇根的那些奶牛之一
like he was one of those cows in Michigan.

473
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,440
什么密歇根的奶牛
What cows in Michigan?

474
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,530
《时事60分钟》上播过
It was on 60 Minutes

475
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,580
那些奶牛被杂散电压电死了
over those cows that got zapped by stray voltage.

476
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,070
没人知道原因  也许是在威斯康辛州吧
No one knows why. And maybe it was Wisconsin.

477
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,420
不过  无论如何
But, anyway,

478
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,790
我当时听着他说他有多爱妻子
I was listening to him talk about how much he loved his wife

479
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,410
忽然我就哭了
and suddenly I was crying.

480
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,590
我看那些电话公司的广告时也会这样
It's like what happens when I watch those phone company ads.

481
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,730
都不用全部看完  
I don't have to see the whole thing,

482
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,090
只要看女儿把冰箱送给妈妈那一段
just the part where the daughter gives the mother the refrigerator

483
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,970
-上面还系着个红蝴蝶结  -红蝴蝶结
- with the big red bow. - ... big red bow

484
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,800
没错  还有宝丽来的广告
Yes. The Polaroid commercial,

485
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,060
两个五岁小孩在他们祖父的生日派对上
two 5-year-olds at their grandfather's birthday party.

486
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,640
-他们在用胶水往相册上贴照片  -太戳心了
- They're making the album with the glue. - That kills me!

487
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,470
你应该写写这事
You should write something about this.

488
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,490
写什么事
About what?

489
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,980
管它算什么事  写就是了
Whatever it is.

490
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,140
我告诉你这算什么事
I tell you what it is:

491
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,690
两千个女人给电台打电话就为了找老公
Two thousand women calling a radio station for a husband?

492
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,910
如今急不可耐要追寻爱情的女人真是一抓一大把
There are a lot of desperate women out there looking for love.

493
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,780
尤其在过了某个特定的年龄之后
Especially over a certain age.

494
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,330
你要知道  被恐怖分子杀掉的几率
You know it's easier to be killed by a terrorist

495
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,080
都比在四十岁之后成功结婚要高
than it is to get married over 40.

496
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
不是这样的  这个统计结果是假的
That is not true. That statistic is not true.

497
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,620
确实如此  不是真的  但感觉像真的
That's right, it's not true. But it feels true.

498
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,420
感觉像真的  因为这就是真的
It feels true because it's true.

499
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,380
其实还有人写了本书
There is practically a whole book

500
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,090
来论证这项统计结果有多假
about how that statistic is not true.

501
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,650
冷静点  是你挑起的话头
Calm down, you brought it up.

502
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,220
我才没有  怀亚特
I did not, Wyatt.

503
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,260
你读过那本书吗
Did you even read that book?

504
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,430
有谁读完过那本书吗
Did anybody read that book all the way through?

505
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,590
你俩吵完了吗
Are you two finished?

506
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,840
行  我们刚刚说到哪儿了
Fine, now where were we?

507
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,690
如果某人是个鳏夫
If someone's a widower,

508
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,760
为什么人们要说他是"寡居"
why do they say that he was "widowed"?

509
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,800
为什么不说他是"鳏居"呢
Why don't they say he was "widowered"?

510
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,810
我只是好奇罢了
I was just wondering.

511
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,360
刚刚是怎么回事
What was that about up there?

512
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,260
什么怎么回事
What was what?

513
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,150
你怎么了
What's with you?

514
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,520
我没事啊
Nothing's with me.

515
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,940
你肯定有事
Something's with you.

516
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,840
你什么意思
What are you saying?

517
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,740
不管什么事  你都可以告诉我
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

518
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,410
西雅图夜未眠先生
Sleepless in Seattle?

519
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,030
她在节目中就这么称呼他的  因为他晚上会失眠
That's what she called him on the show because he can't sleep.

520
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,660
于是现在有两千个女人想要他的电话号码
And now 2000 women want his number.

521
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,790
那家伙可能是个疯子
The guy could be a crackhead,

522
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,180
异装癖者  暴露狂  瘾君子  电锯杀人狂
a transvestite, a flasher, a junkie, a chainsaw murderer

523
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,460
或者是个死变态  就像我家里克
or someone really sick, someone like my Rick.

524
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,760
其实  他听上去像是个很好的人
Actually, he sounded nice.

525
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,010
是吗
Oh, really?

526
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,560
终于说到点子上了
Now we're getting down to it.

527
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,610
拜托  贝琪  我正和沃尔特热恋
Please, Becky. I'm madly in love with Walter.

528
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,320
那天晚上他做了一件超疯狂的事
He did the craziest thing the other night.

529
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,350
是什么事来着
What was that?

530
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,650
特别有意思  我们都笑疯了  是什么事来着
Oh, it was so funny, we were hysterical, what was that?

531
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,420
我在想着
You know, I was thinking,

532
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,790
我不是得去波士顿参加生物分析学家大会吗
I've gotta go to Boston for the AAB convention, right?

533
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,180
之后我还要去温斯顿·休斯公司
And then I gotta visit Winston-Hughes

534
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,510
谈谈更换电脑的相关事宜
about switching over our computers...

535
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,320
我们何不在纽约见面
Why don't we meet in New York

536
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,340
共度情人节周末呢
for Valentine's Day weekend.

537
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,050
沃尔特  我很愿意
Walter, I'd love to!

538
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,810
我们可以住在广场酒店
We can stay at the Plaza.

539

"敬我们"
"Here's to us."

584
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,450
你以前经常说的是  "敬我们"
You used to say, "Here's to us."

585
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,600
亲爱的
Oh, babe.

586
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,580
我想你想到心痛
I miss you so much it hurts.

587
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,960
-你要干什么  -等他来的时候告诉他
- What do you wanna do? - Well, tell him, tell him when he gets here.

588
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,230
-你想告诉他吗  我不介意  -你能告诉他吗
- You want to tell him? I don't mind telling him. - You can tell him?

589
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,390
-她来了 -她回来了  她有别的想法
- She's here. - She's back. She has another idea.

590
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,740
-别走别走  -我可没这功夫
- No, no, no. - I don't need this.

591
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,230
-萨姆  很高兴你来了  -你还好吗  克莱尔
- Sam, I'm so glad you're here. - Claire, how are you?

592
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,810
我听到你在节目里说的话了  我已经跟大家说了
I heard you on the radio. I told everyone about it.

593
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,070
-我们已经知道了  -你们是怎么...
- We already knew. - How did you...?

594
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,670
-格蕾丝  -那个调度员
- Grace. - The dispatcher?

595
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,090
-没错  -那全西雅图都知道了
- Yeah. - All of Seattle knows.

596
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,590
我当时正在刷牙  忽然我就听到了你的声音
I was brushing my teeth and, suddenly, there you were.

597
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,680
我不敢相信自己的耳朵
I just couldn't believe my ears.

598
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,770
我给我妈打了电话  她在拉斯维加斯
I called my mother in Las Vegas.

599
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,510
我说  "妈  打开收音机
I said, "Mother, turn on the radio.

600
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,710
节目里的人是我的建筑师"
That's my architect."

601
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:30,990
一个男人能吐露内心的感受真的很好
You know, it's so nice when a man can express his feelings.

602
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,680
-真的很棒  -没错  我也希望自己能表达内心
- It's wonderful. - Yeah, I wish I could express my feelings.

603
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,590
那么  克莱尔  有什么问题吗
So, Claire, is there a problem?

604
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,950
昨晚我辗转反侧
I was tossing and turning last night.

605
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,370
你知道那是什么感觉  萨姆
You know what that's like, Sam.

606
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,830
因为我意识到我们订的那个冰箱
Because I realise I'm never going to fit my platters

607
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,810
绝对装不下我那些大盘子
in that refrigerator we ordered.

608
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,820
当我办派对时  总是会用大盘子
And when I give parties, I always put in platters.

609
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,680
所以我觉得还是订零下的那个冰箱好了
So I thought I would get the sub-zero refrigerator instead.

610
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,540
唯一的问题就是...
And the only problem...

611
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,000
我们得重做所有的橱柜
We have to redo all the cabinets.

612
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,110
我们得...  得打进这堵墙
We're gonna... We'll be into this wall.

613
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,890
-那是承重墙  -克莱尔  那样就得延工...
- That's bearing wall. - That's a delay, Claire, of...

614
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,820
-两  三...  -五  六...
- Two, three... - Five, six...

615
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,450
-十二周  -我不介意
- Twelve weeks. - I don't mind.

616
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,160
重要的是搞定这事
The important thing is to get it right.

617
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,870
-保证搞定  -你说话要算话
- Absolutely. - Your words.

618
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,820
我得走了  室内装潢师来电话了
Oh, I've gotta rush. La décorateur calls.

619
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,050
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - Bye.

620
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,140
这就是命运
Well, this is fate.

621
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,180
她离婚了
She's divorced,

622
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,790
我们不想重做橱柜  而你缺个老婆
we don't wanna redo the cabinets, and you need a wife.

623
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,390
当这一切交织在一起时  那叫什么来着
What do they call that, when everything intersects?

624
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,970
百慕大三角
The Bermuda Triangle.

625
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,760
还有一个  你还拿得下吗
And here's another one. Do you got room for one more here?

626
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,450
给你  在这签名
Here you go. Right there.

627
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,130
看看  爸爸  这些都是寄给你的
Look at this, Dad. They're all for you.

628
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,530
没错  先生  拿着
Yes, sir. Here you go.

629
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,900
"西雅图夜未眠先生"
"Sleepless in Seattle,"

630
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,450
玛夏·菲尔斯通医生转交
C/o Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.

631
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,720
如果你睡不着  你可以试试
If you're having trouble sleeping, you might wanna try

632
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,290
从杯子远离嘴的那面喝水
drinking a glass of water from the other side.

633
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,840
-我还以为这办法是用来治打嗝的  -能治打嗝吗
- I thought that was for hiccups. - Does it work for hiccups?

634
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,850
要治打嗝的话  舀一勺糖
For hiccups, take a spoonful of sugar,

635
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,580
含在嘴里一分钟
hold it in your mouth for a minute.

636
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,570
真的吗
Really?

637
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,400
谢谢
Thank you.

638
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,920
你为什么把我们的地址给他们
What possessed you to give them our address?

639
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,820
他们打电话过来问了
They called and asked for it.

640
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,370
"亲爱的西雅图夜未眠先生
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle

641
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:17,380
你是我听过的最有魅力的男人"
you're the most attractive man I ever lay ears on."

642
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,570
等等  他们打电话来了
Wait, wait, wait. They called?

643
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,020
他们怎么会有我们的电话号码
How did they get our number?

644
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,150
让我猜猜  你告诉他们的
Oh, let me guess. You gave it to them.

645
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,380
你必须把电话号码给他们
You have to give them your phone number

646
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,210
否则就不让你上节目
or they won't let you on the air.

647
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,240
"亲爱的西雅图夜未眠先生  我住在塔尔萨"
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle. I live in Tulsa."

648
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,460
那地方在哪里
Where's that?

649
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,380
在俄克拉荷马州
It's in Oklahoma.

650
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,790
-你知道俄克拉荷马在哪吗  -中部某个地方吧
- You know where Oklahoma is? - Somewhere in the middle.

651
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,070
我都不愿意去想
I'm not even gonna think

652
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,850
学校到底有多少东西没教你
about what they're not teaching you in school.

653
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,060
我都不愿意去想
I'm not even gonna think about it.

654
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,060
没错  是在中部某个地方  总的来说
Yeah, somewhere in the middle. And, generally speaking

655
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,280
我们应该排除任何不住在这附近的人
I think we should rule out anyone that doesn't live near here.

656
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,990
她愿意飞到任何地方
She's willing to fly anywhere.

657
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,750
她长得像我三年级的老师
She looks like my third-grade teacher.

658
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,130
我讨厌我三年级的老师
I hated my third-grade teacher.

659
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,040
等等
Wait a minute.

660
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,230
她就是我三年级的老师
She is my third-grade teacher!

661
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,830
这些信你一封都不打算看吗
Aren't you gonna read any of these?

662
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,980
不打算  因为事不是这样办的
No. Cause this is not how it's done.

663
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,930
我更愿意
I'd much rather just

664
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,150
见见我喜欢的人
see somebody I like

665
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,790
面对面地感受她们
and get a feeling about them,

666
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,630
问问她们想不想出去喝一杯
ask them if they wanna have a drink.

667
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,840
-或者吃点披萨  -不吃晚餐
- Or a slice of pizza? - Not dinner.

668
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,270
初次约会不一定要共进晚餐
Not necessarily on the first date,

669
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,130
因为晚餐吃到一半
because halfway through dinner,

670
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,430
你可能会很后悔约对方共进晚餐
you could be really sorry you asked them to dinner.

671
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,140
不过  如果只是喝一杯的话
Whereas, if it's just a drink

672
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,770
如果你喜欢对方  总有机会邀请她共进晚餐
if you like them, you can always ask them to dinner.

673
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,000
但如果没感觉  你也可以直接说
But if not, you can just say,

674
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,730
"嗯  今晚挺不错的"
"Well, that was great,"

675
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,070
然后就各回各家
And then you go home.

676
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,610
懂我的意思了吗
You see what I mean?

677
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,040
我很好奇现在的约会方式还是不是这样
I wonder if it still works this way.

678
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,990
不是了  女孩子会主动邀请你 
It doesn't. They ask you.

679
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,820
我开始注意到了
I'm starting to notice that.

680
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,270
如果你娶了个新老婆  你应该会跟她上床吧
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?

681
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,160
我当然希望如此
I certainly hope so.

682
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,960
她会抓你的背吗
Will she scratch up your back?

683
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,740
什么
What?

684
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,810
电影里  女人总是抓着男人的背尖叫
In movies, women always scratch up the man's back and screaming.

685
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,630
他们上床时就会这样
Stuff when they are having sex.

686
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,390
你怎么会知道
How do you know this?

687
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,290
杰德家有有线电视
Jed's got cable.

688
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,070
杰德家有...
Oh, Jed's got...

689
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,360
把你身后那条毛巾递给我
Hand me that towel behind you.

690
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,050
-谢谢  -我也得擦擦
- Thank you. - I need it too.

691
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,380
来  我来帮你擦
Here, let me get you.

692
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,310
"杰德家有有线电视"  来吧
"Jed's got cable!" Come on.

欢迎回到玛夏·菲尔斯通医生的节目精选集
Welcome back to the best of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone

707
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,300
她是一位临床心理学家  也是你从未有过的挚友
clinical psychologist and the friend you never had.

708
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,250
还记得迈阿密的孤独小姐吗
Remember Marooned in Miami?

709
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,270
他说他不再爱我了
He says he doesn't love me anymore.

710
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,340
你为什么会想和一个不爱你的人在一起
Why would you wanna be with someone who doesn't love you?

711
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,410
丹佛的失望女士
Disappointed in Denver.

712
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,490
每次我快高潮的时候
Every time I come close to orgasm,

713
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,760
他都会抽身去给自己做三明治吃
he goes to make himself a sandwich.

714
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,850
你为什么不提前给他做个三明治呢
Why don't you make him a sandwich beforehand.

715
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,880
西雅图的夜未眠先生
Sleepless in Seattle.

716
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:09,280
我打算每天早上起床
Well, I'm going to get out of bed every morning.

717
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,070
一整天都保持呼吸
Breathe in and out all day long.

718
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,670
一段时间过后  我就不必再提醒自己
And then after a while, I won't have to remind myself

719
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,740
每天早上要起床  要保持呼吸
to get out of bed every morning and breathe in and out.

720
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,040
再过一段时间  我就不会再想着
And then after a while, I won't have to think about

721
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,260
我也曾拥有过一段精彩而完美的人生
how I had it great and perfect for a while.

722
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,900
萨姆  告诉我你的妻子究竟有何特别之处
Sam, tell me what was so special about your wife?

723
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,080
你的节目有多长时间
Well, how long is your programme?

724
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,400
其实...
Oh, well, it was...

725
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,520
其实是无数件小事
Oh, it was a million tiny, little things.

726
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,320
当这些小事积少成多
When you added them all up

727
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,050
这就意味着我们注定在一起
it just meant that we were supposed to be together.

728
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,970
我知道
And I knew it.

729
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,550
当我第一次触碰她时我就知道了
I knew it the first time I touched her.

730
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,150
感觉就像回家
It was like coming home,

731
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,660
我不曾知晓的那个家
only to no home I'd ever known.

732
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,230
我当时只是牵着她的手
I was just taking her hand,

733
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,070
扶她下车
to help her out of a car.

734
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,430
然后我就知道了
And I knew it.

735
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,540
那感觉就像
It was like...

736
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,570
魔法
Magic.

737
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,780
我觉得我要疯了
Well, I think I'm going crazy,

738
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,250
丹尼斯  我真的快疯了  你的婚姻幸福吗
Dennis. I really do. Are you happily married?

739
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,150
-什么  -我是说...
- What? - I mean...

740
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,490
你为什么要结婚  是因为那些乐队和烟火吗
Why did you get married? Was it all trumpets and fireworks?

741
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,910
我结婚是因为贝琪说我们要么分手要么结婚
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.

742
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,130
于是我们就结婚了
So we got married.

743
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,620
但当你初次遇见她时
But when you first met her,

744
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,820
你相不相信她就是你的真命天女
did you believe that she was the only person for you,

745
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,620
而这一切都是命运神秘的安排
that in some mystical, cosmic way it was fated?

746
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,070
安妮
Annie,

747
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,950
当你被某人吸引  只能说在潜意识中
when you're attracted to someone, it means your subconscious

748
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,870
你的潜意识被他们的潜意识吸引了
is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.

749
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,530
我们所认为的命运
What we think of as fate is

750
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,130
不过是两个疯子觉得他们是天造地设的一对罢了
just two neuroses knowing they're a perfect match.

751
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,120
我甚至都不认识他
I don't even know him.

752
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:24,270
我在幻想一个我未曾谋面的男人
I'm having all of these fantasies about some man I've never even met,

753
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,300
他还住在西雅图
who lives in Seattle!

754
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,560
西雅图一年之中有九个月都在下雨
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.

755
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,600
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

756
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,700
我不想搬去西雅图
I do not wanna move to Seattle.

757
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,300
但我真正不希望的
But what I really don't wanna do

758
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,910
是总幻想着可能会发生的一切
is end up always wondering what might've happened

759
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,820
并明知自己本可以做些什么
and knowing I could've done something.

760
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,470
你怎么看
What do you think?

761
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,560
我只是临阵退缩  不是吗
It's just cold feet, isn't it?

762
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,760
每个人在结婚前都会恐慌
Everybody panics before they get married.

763
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,700
难道你没有过吗
I mean, didn't you?

764
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,370
我有过
Yes, I did.

765
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,540
没错  你有过  多谢你了  丹尼斯
Yes, you did. Thank you very much, Dennis.

766
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,380
把这些话说出来之后我觉得好多了
I feel so much better just having blown this off.

767
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,440
随时效劳
Anytime.

768
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,190
桑迪有个闺蜜  格伦达  她是个举重运动员
Sandy has a girlfriend, Glenda. She's a weightlifter.

769
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,350
那姑娘可不是什么脑袋大脖子粗的货色...
Alright, it's not like her neck is bigger than her head...

770
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,540
不不不  我不是让你帮我介绍对象
No, I'm not asking you to set me up.

771
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,480
我不需要你帮那种忙
I don't need your help with that.

772
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,620
我只是想知道  现在的情场是怎样的
I wanna know what it's like, you know, out there.

773
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,750
我就是想告诉你这个
That's what I'm trying to tell you

774
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,650
女人们寻求的是什么  胸肌和翘臀
what women are looking for: Pecs and a cute butt.

775
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,490
-比如"他的屁股超翘"吗  -没错
- Well, you mean like, "He has the cutest butt." - Yeah.

776
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,070
-我最近是从哪儿听来的这话  -到处都在说
- Where did I hear that recently? - Everywhere.

777
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,530
这年头你开个电视
You can't even turn on the news nowadays

778
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:28,090
都免不了听见某些姑娘对男人的屁股评头论足
without hearing some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.

779
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,580
我不知道是哪个女人起的头
Who the first woman to say this was, I don't know,

780
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,140
但这话莫名其妙就火了
but somehow it caught on.

781
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,020
那么我的屁股如何
So how's my butt?

782
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,230
-还不错  -是吗
- Not bad. - Really?

783
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,840
-是啊  -不过算得上翘吗
- Yeah. - Is it cute though?

784
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,570
我不知道  是按曲线打分的吗
I don't know. Are we grading on a curve?

785
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,680
你上次和人约会是什么时候
When was the last time you were out there?

786
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,900
吉米·卡特当总统的时候  1978年
Jimmy Carter, 1978.

787
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,280
现在情况有些不同了
Things are a little different now.

788
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,160
首先  你们得做朋友
First, you have to be friends.

789
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,990
你们得喜欢彼此
You have to like each other.

790
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,640
然后你们会拥吻
Then you neck.

791
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,720
这个阶段可能会持续好几年
This could go on for years.

792
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,260
然后你们要去体检  接着你就可以戴套和她上床
Then you have tests, then you get to do it with a condom.

793
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,550
好消息就是大家各付各的帐
The good news is you split the cheque.

794
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,600
我觉得我是不会让女士付晚餐钱的
I don't think I could let a woman pay for dinner.

795
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,300
真棒  她们会为你举办一个游行
Great! They'll throw a parade in your honour.

796
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,590
你会是《西雅图杂志》上的年度男士
You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.

797
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,110
提拉米苏
Tiramisu.

798
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,100
-什么是提拉米苏  -你会知道的
- What is tiramisu? - You'll find out.

799
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,460
-到底是什么  -你会明白的
- Well, what is it? - You'll see.

800
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,150
如果某个女人想让我对她做那个
Some woman is gonna want me to do it to her,

801
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,580
但我却不知道那是什么  那怎么办
and I'm not gonna know what it is.

802
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,750
你会喜欢的
You'll love it.

803
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,310
这太难了
Oh, this is gonna be tough.

804
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,570
太难了  太难了  重返情场比我想的要难多了
Tough, tough. It's gonna be much tougher than I thought.

805
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,710
你觉得本内特雇的那个装潢师怎么样
What about that decorator on the Bennett job?

806
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,020
-维多利亚吗  -没错  她很活泼
- Victoria? - Yeah. She's perky.

807
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,460
-不  我不...  -怎么了
- Oh, no, I don't... - What?

808
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,610
-这根本就不是我的风格  -什么  不
- That's not I'm way. I'm far away from that. - What? No.

809
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,850
-我目前只是在收集信息...  -信息
- I'm just assembling notes. I'm not... - Notes.

810
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,790
-我要怎么办  -什么叫你要怎么办
- How would I do that? - What do you mean how do you do?

811
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,400
你给她打电话
You call her up.

812
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,680
你就说  "我们见个面  看一下颜色板"
You say, "Come, let's get together. We'll look at swatches."

813
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,560
给她打电话
Call her on the phone

814
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,520
说  "来  我们看一下颜色板"
to say, "Come, let's look at swatches"?

815
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,830
对啊  配色方案嘛
Yeah, you know, colour schemes.

816
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,310
她难道不会看穿我的企图吗
She's not gonna see right through that?

817
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,690
不  你不必学我的招数
No, you don't do it like I do it.

818
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,930
你可以用你自己的那种温和方式
You do it in your own suave way.

819
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,670
想想加里·格兰特[著名男演员]Think Cary Grant.

820
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,520
-加里·格兰特会打电话说...  -想想加里·格兰特
- Cary Grant would call up and say, - Think Cary Grant.

821
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,120
-"过来看一下我的颜色板"吗  -拜托
- "Come over and look at my swatches"? - Hello.

822
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,250
你怎么知道  也许他会呢
How do you know? Maybe he did.

823
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,480
-他没有这么做  -我知道他没有在电影里这么做
- He didn't do it. - I know he didn't do it in the movies.

824
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,490
-你是说《古庙战笳声》吗  他没有...  -不是
- Gunga Din? He didn't call...? - No.

825
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:17,420
《古庙战笳声》不是那种爱情电影
Gunga Din is not a swatch kind of movie.

826
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,920
谁知道他在现实生活中会怎么做
Who knows what he did in real life.

827
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,390
但他对黛恩·坎农用了这招吗
But he did that with Dyan Cannon?

828
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,390
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}美国女演员  加里·格兰特前妻

829
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,390
可不是嘛
Yeah, sure.

830
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,940
"你好  黛恩  来看看这些颜色板吧"
"Hello, Dyan! Take a look at these swatches."

831
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,210
乔纳  我回来了
Jonah, I'm home!

832
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,330
乔纳
Hey, Jonah!

833
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:58,930
乔纳
Jonah?

834
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,180
乔纳
Hey, Jonah.

835
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,540
乔纳  人呢
Hey, Jonah.

836
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,460
爸爸  这位是杰西卡
Hi, Dad. This is Jessica.

837
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,960
很高兴认识你  杰西卡
Well, it's nice to meet you, Jessica.

838
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,720
爸爸  这真的太不可思议了
Dad, this is amazing.

839
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,420
如果你倒着放这张碟  听上去就像"保罗死了"
If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."

840
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,710
对  没错  我知道
Yeah, yeah. I know.

841
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,740
你怎么会知道
How do you know?

842
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,890
爸爸  你能把门关上吗
Dad, could you shut the door?

843
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,910
当然  当然
Sure. Sure.

844
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,790
你  再
H and G.

845
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,860
你好  再见

你好  是维多利亚吗
Hello, Victoria?

857
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,470
我是萨姆·鲍德温  我不知道你是否记得我  但...
This is Sam Baldwin. I don't know if you remember me, but...

858
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,660
太好了
Oh, great.

859
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,740
我在想...
I was wondering if...

860
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:10,060
你是否愿意和我喝一杯
If you would like to have a drink with me?

861
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,280
晚餐吗
Dinner?

862
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,970
晚餐那就更好了
Dinner would be even better.

863
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:20,430
周五挺好的  没问题  没问题
Friday would be great, yeah, yeah.

864
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,570
那要怎样...  我听说那里很不错
How...? I hear that's a good place.

865
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,550
7点半可以
7:30 would be fine.

866
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,390
那我就...
And I'll...

867
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:36,050
好的  我们在那里见面  好的  没问题
Okay, I'll meet you there. Okay. All right.

868
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:42,140
所以我们在周五晚7点半共进晚餐
So it's Friday at 7:30 for dinner.

869
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,400
很好
Great.

870
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,050
我也是  再见
Me too. Bye.

871
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,800
{\an9}♪我重又跨上马鞍♪
♪ Back in the saddle again ♪

872
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:55,960
你爱他吗
Are you in love with him?

873
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,650
现在不爱
I'm not now.

874
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:05,260
那时的人们还懂得如何去爱
Now those were the days when people knew how to be in love.

875
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,620
-你没救了  -他们知道的
- You're a basket case. - They knew it.

876
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:11,780
时间  距离  没什么能将他们分开  因为他们知道
Time, distance, nothing could separate them because they knew.

877
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:15,550
-那是对的  那是真的  那是...  -一部电影
- It was right. It was real. It was... - A movie.

878
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,080
这就是你的问题所在  你想的不是谈恋爱
That's your problem. You don't wanna be in love.

879
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,120
你想的是在电影里谈恋爱
You wanna be in love in a movie.

880
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,570
把写的信读给我听听
Read it to me.

881
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,250
"亲爱的夜未眠先生及其子
"Dear Sleepless and Son.

882
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,930
我此生从未写过这样一封信..."
I've never written a letter like this in my life..."

883
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,120
大家在给陌生人写信的时候
That's what everyone writes

884
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,380
都会千篇一律用这个开头
at the beginning of letters to strangers.

885
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,050
我知道啊  你以为我不知道吗
I know that. You think I don't know that?

886
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:35,930
沃尔特怎么办
What about Walter?

887
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,640
沃尔特
Oh, Walter.

888
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,490
只要能嫁给沃尔特  我愿意付出一切
Oh, I'd give anything to marry Walter.

889
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,990
他是如此的出人意料
He's so unexpected.

890
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,440
你以为你能看穿他的为人
You think you can tell what he's like by just looking at him,

891
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,840
但你不能
but you can't.

892
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,610
我应该在信里写点跟魔法有关的东西
I should write something in this about magic.

893
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:52,370
什么
What?

894
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,320
总要写点什么吧  万一我永远不会遇见他呢
Something! What if I never meet him?

895
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,140
万一他是我的真命天子  而我却永远不会遇见他呢
What if this man is my destiny, and I never meet him?

896
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,900
真命天子也有可能是命中灾星  看看我和里克
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.

897
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:01,730
"我想见你..."
"I want to meet you..."

898
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,570
在帝国大厦楼顶见面如何
How about the top of the Empire State Building?

899
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,820
我想在帝国大厦楼顶见你
On the top of the Empire State Building.

900
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:09,610
在情人节的黄昏
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

901
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,860
我那时会和沃尔特一起待在纽约  我可以挤时间去
I'll be in New York with Walter. I can squeeze it in.

902
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,670
我会和沃尔特一起待在纽约
I'll be in New York with Walter!

903
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,160
你想听听什么叫命运弄人吗
Do you wanna hear about destiny?

904
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,000
如果我没有嫁给马丁
If I hadn't married Martin

905
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,310
我就不会买下那栋长着一棵死树的房子
I never would've bought the house with the dead tree.

906
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,450
也正因此我才离婚
On account of which I got divorced.

907
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,310
也正因此我才会撞到别的车
On account of which I hit a car

908
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,590
并且在买颈托的时候遇到里克
and met Rick while buying a neck brace.

909
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,500
等等
Wait a minute.

910
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,940
你从没告诉过我你离婚是因为一棵死树
You never told me you got a divorce because of a dead tree?

911
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,800
是因为那个绿化工
The tree man.

912
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,370
你爱上了一个绿化工
You fell in love with the tree man?

913
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,880
我没说"爱"
I did not say "Love."

914
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,130
我说"爱"了吗
Did I say "Love"?

915
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,660
这是我最喜欢的一段
This is my favourite part.

916
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,110
机不可失  时不再来
It's now or never.

917
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,730
时不再来  听着有些吓人
Never is a frightening word.

918
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,080
傻子才会让幸福擦肩而过
We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by.

919
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,890
对那些没有温暖回忆的人来说  冬天一定很冷
Winter must be cold for those with no warm memories.

920
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,190
我们已经错过了春天
We've already missed the spring.

921
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,340
是啊
Yes.

922
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,620
男人永远看不懂这部电影
Men never get this movie.

923
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,120
我也觉得
I know.

924
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,370
妈妈  妈妈
Mummy! Mummy!

925
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,660
-妈妈  -没事的  没事的
- Mummy! - It's okay. It's okay.

926
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,320
我在呢  
I'm here.

927
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,180
-爸爸  -我来了  
- Dad! - I'm coming.

928
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,090
没事了  别怕  没事了
It's all right. It's okay. It's okay.

929
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,100
没事的  不用怕  没事的
It's okay, it's all right. It's okay.

930
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,650
-做什么噩梦了  -在下沉
- What was that about, huh? - It was sinking.

931
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,270
-什么在下沉  -我们家
- What was? - Our house.

932
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,780
每个窗口都有水涌进来
There was water coming in all the windows.

933
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,280
现在没事了
Well, it's okay now.

934
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:52,560
没事了
It's all right.

935
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,060
那我们该怎么办呢
So, what should we do?

936
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:00,890
你以前做噩梦的时候  妈妈会给你唱歌
Your mother used to sing to you when you had bad dreams.

937
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:03,640
《再见黑鸟》
"Bye Bye Blackbird."

938
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:06,780
是啊
Yeah.

939
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,480
我想她了
I miss her.

940
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,490
你觉得一个人死了之后  会发生些什么
What do you think happens to someone after they die?

941
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:17,170
-我不知道  -比如  你相信有天堂吗
- I don't know. - Like, do you believe in heaven?

942
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,340
我从未相信过
I never did.

943
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:26,950
我也不相信会有死后的世界  但现在  我不知道了
Or the whole idea of an afterlife. But now, I don't know.

944
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,480
因为我会做一些梦
Because I have these dreams about...

945
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,870
梦到你妈妈
about your mum.

946
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:38,180
没错  我们会聊上很久
Yeah. And we have long talks.

947
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,710
聊聊你  你过得怎么样
About you. How you're doing.

948
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:47,580
她应该也知道  不过我还是会告诉她
Which she sort of knows, but I tell her anyway.

949
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,490
这是怎么回事呢
So, what is that?

950
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,070
她应该就在死后的世界吧  不是吗
It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?

951
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,230
我开始忘记她了
I'm starting to forget her.

952
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,760
她可以削完一个苹果
She could peel an apple

953
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,460
长长卷卷的皮是完整的 
in one long, curly strip.

954
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,300
削一整个苹果都不会断
The whole apple.

Do I look okay? Do I look all right?

I have been an excellent third baseman

1035
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,770
我都一直是一个很出色的三垒手
for as long as I or anyone else can remember

1036
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:13,670
既然谈到了这个话题  这么说吧
and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now:

1037
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,170
布鲁克斯·罗宾森是有史以来最出色的三垒手
Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever.

1038
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,850
你能同意这个观点  对我来说很重要
It's important that you agree with me on that

1039
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:18,850
因为我是巴尔的摩人"
because I'm from Baltimore."

1040
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,520
她认为布鲁克斯·罗宾森最出色  你也这么认为
She thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest. So do you.

1041
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:24,810
-大家都这么认为  -这是个预兆
- Everyone thinks thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest. - It's a sign.

1042
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:25,810
过来
Come here.

1043
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,040
我让你看看什么叫预兆
I'll show you a sign.

1044
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:29,780
这里就有个预兆
Here's a sign.

1045
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,020
好了
All right.

1046
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,190
西雅图在哪
Where's Seattle?

1047
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,400
没错  巴尔的摩在哪
Right. Where is Baltimore?

1048
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,460

1050
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,380
这两个地方之间隔了26个州  这才是预兆
26 states between here and there. Now, that's a sign.

1051
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,390
我要出门了
I'm out of here.

-谢谢  德里克  -不客气

-你很漂亮  -你也很帅
- You look good. - You look good yourself.

1062
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,570
我还以为你永远不会给我打电话
I thought you'd never gonna call me.

1063
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,880
-你真的这么想  -我真的很希望你打电话
- You did? - I really wanted you to.

1064
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,830
但我以为你永远不会给我打电话
And I thought you were never going to.

1065
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,010
-打扰一下  鲍德温先生  -怎么了
- Excuse me, Mr. Baldwin? - Yes.

1066

有你的电话
There's a phone call for you.

1067
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:33,630
失陪
Excuse me.

1068
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:39,480
谢谢

1069
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,140

1072
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:46,780
来自巴尔的摩的安妮·里德

1076
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,810
你跌倒了吗  在流血吗
Have you fallen down? Are you bleeding?

1077
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:58,790
克拉丽丝在吗  她被勒死了吗
Is Clarise there? Has she been strangled?

1078
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:01,870
-没有  -所以你打电话来就为了这个
- No. - So this is the only reason for this phone call?

1079
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,710
如果我们现在订往返机票  可以享受优惠
If we book now, we can get an excursion fare.

1080
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:07,400
杰西卡的父母是旅行代理人  杰西卡的...
Jessica's parents are travel agents, and Jessica's...

1081
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,880
我现在不想和你谈论这个话题
I'm not having this conversation right now.

1082
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,760
我们晚点再谈
We'll talk about it at a later time.

1083
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,760
我不敢相信就这点破事我们居然能聊这么久
I can't believe this conversation has lasted this long.

1084
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,210
你赶快上床睡觉
You go to bed.

1085
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,340
-一切还好吧  -没事

1086
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,190
-你有孩子吗  -没有
- Do you have kids? - No.

1087
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,350
想要我的孩子吗
Do you want mine?

1088
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,990
我要一杯不加冰的绝对伏特加  谢谢
I'll have an Absolut straight up, please.

1089
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,500
好
Sure.

1090
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,250
放下  别玩了
Hey, hey! Put that down. Stop it!

1091
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,380
她来了
There she is.

1092
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:00,310
她为什么要带食材过来
Why is she bringing those groceries?

1093
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,770
她要为我们下厨  你要做好准备
She's gonna cook us something so be prepared.

1094
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:04,400
你好  萨姆  谢谢
Hi, Sam. Thanks.

1095
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,140
谢谢
Thanks.

1096
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:06,690
我猜猜
And let me guess.

1097
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,510
你一定就是乔纳了
You must be Jonah.

1098
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:11,600
你好
Hi.

1099
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,200
-就这么多吗  -没错
- So this it? - Yeah.

1100
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,190
-车在那边  -太好了
- The car's down this way. - Great.

1101
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,620
这都是她换的第六个油漆工了
She's on her sixth painter

1102
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,900
这活永远都干不完了
and we are never going to finish this job.

1103
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:24,290
现在她又想把壁炉重新装一遍
Now she wants the fireplace rebricked.

1104
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:26,380
我很了解她  我可以给她打个电话
I know her pretty well. I could give her a call.

1105
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,420
不用了  我可以解决
No, I've got it solved.

1106
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,120
我用那些壁炉砖头砸她就行了
I'll just hit her with one of those bricks.

1107
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,550
太好笑了  你真风趣
That's so funny. You're so funny.

1108
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,470
当她想装修的时候  她就会开始喋喋不休
When she wants something done she goes this whole song and says,

1109
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:40,950
"我不知道  我好蠢
"Oh, I don't know. I'm stupid.

1110
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,930
你告诉我吧  你比我清楚
You tell me. You know better than I would.

1111
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,940
我们能不能直接把房子翻个面
But couldn't we flip the house around

1112
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,730
这样的话  所有东西都会移动到另一边
so that everything on one side is now on the other,

1113
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,690
本来在后面的东西会移动到前面
everything in the back is now in front?

1114
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,350
能不能给房子的前门装上一个大铰链
And could the whole front of the house open on one great big hinge

1115
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:53,760
这样我就能用车库开门器开门了"
that I can get in with a garage opener."

1116
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,260
"当然  当然可以这么做  只是需要..."
"Well. Yeah. Yeah, we can. We can do that. We'll just gonna have to..."

1117
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,610
"拆掉橱柜"
"Move the kitchen cabinets."

1118
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:10,320
乔纳  你吃完之后把餐具拿过来  好吗
Hey, Jonah, bring some of that stuff around, all right?

1119
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,620
你喜欢棒球吗
Do you like baseball?

1120
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:18,930
喜欢  我公司有西雅图水手队的包厢票
Yes, I do. In fact my firm has box seats to the Mariners.

1121
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,790
不如我们以后一起去看
Why don't we all go some time.

1122
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,670
-那露营呢  -露营怎么了
- What about camping? - What about it?

1123
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:26,460
你喜欢露营吗
Do you like camping?

1124
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,720
我曾经露营过一次
I went camping once.

1125
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,190
爸爸  我们以后应该经常去露营
You know what, Dad, we ought to start camping more often.

1126
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:35,640
你说得对  露营很不错  上床时间到了
You're right. Camping is good. Time for bed.

1127
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:39,350
-现在才10点  -没错  10点  上床时间
- It's only 10:00. - Yeah, 10:00. Time for bed.

1128
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,650
晚安
Good night.

1129
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,120
难道你不想感谢维多利亚为我们做了美味晚餐吗
Hey, don't you wanna thank Victoria for this delicious dinner?

1130
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,360
谢谢你做的晚餐  
Thanks for dinner.

1131
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,120
我第一次看见有人这么做土豆
I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.

1132
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,710
很高兴你喜欢
I'm glad you liked it.

1133
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:58,250
晚安  乔纳
Good night, Jonah.

1134
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:06,340
我们家不太吃土豆  我们比较喜欢吃米饭
Yeah, we don't see a lot of potatoes around here. We're rice men.

1135
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,820
天哪
Oh, God.

1136
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,930
-对不起  沃尔特  -对不起
- I'm sorry, Walter. - I'm sorry.

1137
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:03,670
对不起
I'm sorry.

1138
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:10,480
-喂  -打开收音机
- Hello. - Turn on your radio.

1139
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:12,580
-怎么了  -那个孩子在热线上
- What? - The kid is on.

1140
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,210
你害得我都开始听这破节目了  去打开收音机
You've got me listening to this garbage. Go, turn it on.

1141
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,410
谁啊
Who is it?

1142
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:22,010
是贝琪  她又和里克闹矛盾了
It's Becky. She's having trouble with Rick again.

1143
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:24,960
我下楼  我下楼打电话  贝琪  我等会儿回电
I'll go downstairs. I'll go downstairs, Becky. I'll call you back.

1144
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,550
对不起  沃尔特  你流血了吗
I'm sorry, Walter. Are you bleeding?

1145
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:53,500
听上去他现在正在亲她
Sounds he's kissing her right this minute!

1146
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,500
真的吗
Oh, really?

1147
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,420
乔纳  说实话  你在监视你父亲吗
Jonah, tell the truth. Are you spying on your father?

1148
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,140
他现在在亲谁
Who is he kissing right this minute?

1149
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,590
-我得阻止他们  -你觉得...
- I have to make them stop. - Do you think...

1150
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:05,430
我该怎么向沃尔特解释
How will I explain this to Walter?

1151
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,260
她过来为我们做晚饭
She came over and cooked dinner.

1152
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,390
她带了两袋食材  就好像要过来住上一整年
She brought two bags of groceries like she was staying here for a year!

1153
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:11,330
乔纳  乔纳
Jonah, Jonah,

1154
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:13,070
你父亲开始约会是好事
it's good that your father's dating.

1155
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:14,940
只是你难以接受罢了
It's just hard on you.

1156
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,810
你以为自己希望父亲开始约会
It's something you think you want,

1157
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,690
但你父亲真的开始约会之后  又吓到了你
but then when it happens, it scares you.

1158
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:20,690
不是这样的
That's not true.

1159
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:21,740
好了  你想想
Okay, now think.

1160
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,650
难道你父亲不应该自己判断
Shouldn't your father be the judge

1161
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,620
一个人到底适不适合他吗
of whether someone is right or wrong for him?

1162
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:29,030
他还不够理智  什么也判断不了
He's not sane enough to judge anything.

1163
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,950
现在他在亲她的嘴
Now he's kissing her on the lips.

1164
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:33,210
她是坏女人  我爸被坏女人迷倒了
She's a ho. My dad's been captured by a ho!

1165
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:34,370
我该怎么办
What am I going to do?

1166
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:36,830
冷静  乔纳  冷静
Calm down, Jonah, calm down.

1167
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,650
明天早上
Tomorrow morning,

1168
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,000
你和爸爸吃早饭的时候
when you're sitting down to breakfast with your dad,

1169
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,960
告诉他你的感受
tell him how you feel.

1170
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:45,710
把自己的感受闷在心里不好
It's not good to keep your feelings inside you.

1171
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:53,800
身穿红衣  躲在杂物柜里  还拿着收音机
Miss Scarlet. In the broom closet. With the radio.

1172
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:55,660
沃尔特
Walter,

1173
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:59,760
你吓到我了  以后不许这样
you scared me. Don't ever do that again.

1174
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,280
我好像看见了一只黑寡妇蜘蛛
I thought I saw a black widow spider.

1175
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,280
你吓死我了  你也把维多利亚吓死了
You scared me to death. You scared Victoria to death.

1176
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,830
就在那里
It was right over there.

1177
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:11,740
下一次  你以为自己
Next time you think you see

1178
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,540
看见黑寡妇蛛的时候  我希望你说
a black widow spider I want you to say:

1179
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,870
"爸  打扰一下
"Dad, excuse me,

1180
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:17,540
我觉得家里进了一只有毒的昆虫"
but I believe a poisonous insect is in the house."

1181
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,710
然后我会冷静地过来处理
And I will calmly come and take care of it.

1182
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,590
你要再这么尖叫  我就宰了你
You scream like that again, I'll kill you.

1183
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:24,380
贝琪在收音机上听到一个人来电  她很肯定是里克
Becky heard this guy on the radio, she was sure it was Rick.

1184
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,920
她气坏了
She was completely hysterical.

1185
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:31,880
后来才发现这个人住在德卢斯  德卢斯在哪
And then it turned out the guy lived in Duluth. Where's Duluth?

1186
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,220
这没道理啊
That doesn't make any sense.

1187
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:36,850
我知道  沃尔特  完全没道理
I know. I know, Walter. It doesn't make any sense at all.

1188
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:38,660
谢天谢地  我的生活井然有序
Thank God my life is in place.

1189
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,220
德卢斯在北达科他州
Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

1190
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,540
我喜欢这封信  你得给她回信
I love this letter. You have to write to her.

1191
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,780
你真的这么想吗
You think so?

1192
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,790
-这是「你唯希」 -是吗  那是什么意思
- It's Y-O-H. - Yeah. What's that?

1193
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:07,830
你唯一的希望
Your only hope.

1194
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:23,140
我想为这些电台节目做报道
I thought I would look into doing a story on those radio shows.

1195
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,100
你大概还得去别的地方好好调查一下
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into them.

1196
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,350
肯定的
Definitely.

1197
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:50,120
难道你不能进行电话采访吗
Couldn't you do a phone interview?

1198
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:52,750
我想做的这篇报道不行
Not for the kind of piece I wanna do.

1199
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,970
我不会在芝加哥待太久的
I won't be in Chicago that long.

1200
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:57,090
等你回来  我都走了
When you get back, I'll be gone.

1201
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,110
那我们就纽约见
Then I'll see you in New York.

1202
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,090
我来开门
I'll get it.

1203
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:10,610
我是布朗宁机长  目前的飞行高度为10668米
This is Captain Browning. We're cruising at 35,000 feet.

1204
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:12,200
西边的天气晴朗
The weather looks clear to the west

1205
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,650
预计可以按时到达西雅图
and we expect to arrive in Seattle on schedule.

1206
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:19,500
-你讨厌乘飞机吗  -讨厌
- Don't you hate flying? - Yes, I do.

1207
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,750
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}Flying (乘飞机)和 Lying (撒谎)
发音有点相似

1208
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:24,030
我刚刚对我的未婚夫撒了一个大谎
And I've just told the most terrible one to the man I'm about to marry.

1209
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,870
难道你不觉得任何谎言都算背叛吗
Do you feel that any lie is a betrayal?

1210
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,410
我说的是乘飞机
I said flying.

1211
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:39,610
谢谢你送我过来
Thanks for bringing me out here.

1212
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,010
他喜欢飞机
Well, he likes the planes.

1213
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:45,400
要我给你带点纪念品回来吗
Can I bring something back for you? A souvenir?

1214
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,150
他喜欢那种雪花水晶球吗
Does he like those little snow globes?

1215
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:49,650
摇一摇  就会有雪落下来的那种水晶球
You know, you shake them up and then the snow floats down.

1216
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:53,680
当然  我很喜欢  非常感谢你
Sure, I'd really like that. Thank you so much.

1217
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:58,500
他才八岁
He's 8.

1218
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:00,200
他很有两下子
He's good at it.

1219
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,660
我读过相关文章
I've read an article about this.

1220
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,750
八岁的孩子都招人讨厌
All children are hideous at the age of 8.

1221
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,530
-这是很正常的现象  -好吧
- It's quite normal. - Well...

1222
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,430
也许等我回来之后
Maybe when I come back,

1223
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:10,150
我们该享受一下二人时光
the two of us ought to spend some time together on our own.

1224
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,040
你觉得呢
What do you think?

1225
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:17,320
再见
Bye.

1226
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,390
再见  乔纳
Bye, Jonah.

1227
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:20,290
再见
Bye.

1228
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:25,800
乔纳
Jonah.

1229
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:28,080
听着
Listen to me.

1230
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:31,280
你不了解维多利亚
You don't know Victoria.

1231
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:36,240
我都不怎么了解她  她对我来说就是个谜
I hardly know her myself. She's, in fact, a mystery to me.

1232
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,270
她经常甩头发  她为什么要这么做
She tosses her hair a lot. Why does she do this?

1233
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:42,290
我不知道  她是抽搐了吗  还是需要剪头发
I have no idea. Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut?

1234
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:45,690
她能用发卡夹一下头发  别让头发挡着脸吗
Could she use a barrette to keep her hair out of her face?

1235
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,820
我很想将这类的事情探究清楚
These are the things I'm willing to get to the bottom of.

1236
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:53,990
所以我才和她约会
That is why I am dating her.

1237
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:56,540
仅此而已
That's all I'm doing.

1238
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,220
我不会和她同居  也不会娶她
I'm not living with her. I'm not marrying her.

1239
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:03,050
你能体会到其中的区别吗
Can you appreciate the difference?

1240
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:05,800
单身的人都会这么做
This is what single people do.

1241
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:08,270
他们和别人约会  看对方是否适合自己
They try other people on and see how they fit.

1242
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:11,760
但大家都在彼此适应  人无完人
But everybody's an adjustment. Nobody's perfect.

1243
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,390
根本就没有什么完美...
There's no such thing as a perfect...

1244
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:31,620
走吧
Come on.

1245
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:38,180
爸爸  我那天和杰西卡聊到来生
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation.

1246
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,800
她说你和安妮在前世认识
She says you knew Annie in another life.

1247
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,970
-安妮是谁  -给我们写信的人
- Who's Annie? - The one who wrote us.

1248
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:46,600
但杰西卡说  你和安妮前世没能在一起
But Jessica says, you and Annie never got together in that life.

1249
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,310
你们的心就好比残缺的拼图
So your hearts are like puzzles with missing pieces.

1250
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:51,440
当你们在一起后  拼图就完整了
And when you get together, the puzzle's complete.

1251
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,890
该死
Goddamn it.

1252
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,780
我知道这件事  而你不知道的原因
The reason I know this and you don't,

1253
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,320
是因为我更年轻  心灵更纯洁
is because I'm younger and purer,

1254
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,060
所以我更能接近宇宙的力量
so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.

1255
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:01,030
这些都是谁告诉你的
Who told you this stuff?

1256
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:02,230
杰西卡
Jessica.

1257
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:05,320
我真心希望你不会和杰西卡结婚
I sincerely hope you're not marrying Jessica.

我看着他在海滩上和儿子玩耍
I watched him play with his son at the beach.

1285
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,860
你去和他说话了吗
Did you talk to him?

1286
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:55,150
我办不到
Couldn't do it.

1287
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,250
我怎么会跑来这里啊
How did I get here?

1288
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:01,300
你撒了个谎  然后上了飞机
You told a lie and got on a plane.

1289
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,950
我不是这个意思
That's not what I mean.

1290
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,910
我明天会再次去那个地方
I'm going back over there tomorrow

1291
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:08,680
然后和他说话  我会的
and talk to him. I am.

1292
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,640
-好的  再见  -贝琪
- Okay. Good. Goodbye. - Beck.

1293
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,500
怎么了
What?

1294
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:17,550
这样做是不是疯了  
Is this crazy?

1295
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,680
不是  这点反而是最奇怪的
No, that's the weirdest part about it.

1296
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:23,010
谢谢
Thank you.

1297
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,140
-我爱你  -我也爱你
- I love you. - I love you too.

1298
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:28,060
-晚安  -再见
- Good night. - Bye.

1299
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:34,330
很高兴见到你  格雷格呢
It's so good to see you. Where's Greg?

1300
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:58,900
你好
Hello.

1301
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:01,530
你好
Hello.

1302
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:12,040
-然后发生了什么  -很显然  我离开了
- So then what happened? - So then I left, obviously.

1303
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,060
你当时站在马路中间吗
You were standing in the middle of the street?

1304
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,430
你知道那种赤身裸体走在大街上
You know that dream when you're walking down the street naked

1305
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:18,930
然后所有人都看着你的那种梦吧
and everyone is looking at you.

1306
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:20,420
我喜欢那种梦
I love that dream.

1307
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,400
和这种羞辱比起来都不算什么  根本不算什么
That was nothing compared to this humiliation. Nothing!

1308
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,260
-但他看见你了  对吗  -他看见我了
- But he saw you, right? - He saw me.

1309
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,150
-你们当时面对面  -他说了"你好"
- You were face to face. - He said hello.

1310
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:31,820
他说了"你好"  你说了什么
He said hello. And what did you say?

1311
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:33,340
我也只能说"你好"
And all I could say was hello.

1312
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:36,190
天哪
Oh, my God.

1313
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:41,780
-我也只能说"你好"  -这是个预兆
- And all I could say was hello. - It's a sign.

1314
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:47,620
-这代表着我看了太多遍这部电影  -安妮
- It's a sign that I have watched this movie too many times. - Oh, Annie.

1315
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,100
太傻了
So stupid!

1316
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:52,840
从我开始听那个破电台节目的那一刻起
From the minute I listened to that stupid programme on the radio,

1317
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,720
我就成了一个彻头彻尾的混蛋
I've been a complete jerk.

1318
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,820
你不是混蛋
You are not a jerk.

1319
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:58,670
谢谢  我是白痴
Thank you. An idiot!

1320
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,600
你不知道她是谁  安妮
You don't know who she was, Annie.

1321
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,850
我见过她  我有她的照片
I saw her. I have a picture of her.

1322
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,600
我给你看她的照片
I'll show you a picture of her.

1323
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:07,520
那个在西雅图的侦探给我寄了一张她的照片
That detective in Seattle sent me a picture of her.

1324
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:11,470
给  你看  这就是她的模样
Here! See, that's exactly what she looks like.

1325
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:14,280
这不过是某个人的背影
This is a picture of someone's back.

1326
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,520
这就是她  而且他非常爱她
Well, it's her and he was crazy about her.

1327
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:18,340
这是什么
What's this?

1328
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,070
这封信是从西雅图寄来的
This is from Seattle.

1329
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,410
贝琪
Becky.

1330
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:34,540
我把你的信寄出去了
So I mailed your letter.

1331
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,480
"亲爱的安妮
"Dear Annie.

1332
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:41,640
感谢你的来信  信写得很好
Thanks for your letter. It was great.

1333
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,050
你似乎是个不错的人
You sound neat.

1334
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:48,650
我们很期待能够在情人节当天
We're very excited about meeting you

1335
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:52,350
和你在纽约见面  看看我们是不是
in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are...

1336
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,640
天对地双
M-f-e-o.

1337
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,360
期待能和你很快见面  西雅图夜未眠先生留"
See you soon. Sleepless in Seattle."

1338
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,820
天对地双
M-f-e-o?

1339
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,700
天造一对  地设一双
Made for each other.

1340
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:11,630
文风很可爱
It's cute.

1341
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:14,240
就像给你留了一条小线索
It's like a little clue.

1342
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:21,760
所以他文笔不好  多大点事
So he can't write. Big deal.

1343
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:24,600
我们总是过度高估男人的语言能力
Verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy.

1344
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,980
正是对这种能力的可悲需求
And our pathetic need for it

1345
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:27,520
才会让我们陷入这么多麻烦
is what gets us into so much trouble.

1346
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,520
我要奔回沃尔特的怀抱  前提是他还要我的话
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he'll still have me.

1347
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:32,730
那这封信呢
What about the letter?

1348
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,240
这封信没有任何意义  这是在我去之前写的
It's nothing. It was written before I went out there.

1349
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,100
在他和那个坏女人好上之前
Before the ho.

1350
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:43,610
唯一的问题是  她看上去不像是坏女人
The only thing is, she didn't look like a ho.

1351
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:46,740
她看上去像是可以和我们做朋友的人
She looked like somebody we would have been friends with.

1352
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:53,550
你在机场见过她  又在这里见到了她
You saw her in the airport and then here?

1353
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:54,590
我想和她说话
And I tried to talk to her.

1354
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:56,840
就好像我认识她一样  感觉很奇怪
It was like I knew her or something. It was weird.

1355
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,260
你是指那种似曾相识的感觉吗
You mean like a déjà-vu thing?

1356
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:01,970
非常法式的似曾相识感  明白吗
It was very French déjà-vu-ish kind of thing. Oui?

1357
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:04,270
明白  至少你又开始约会了
Oui. At least you're out there seeing people again.

1358
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:05,710
这很棒
That's terrific.

1359
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:08,730
其实我只和一个人约过会
Well, I mean, there's really just the one.

1360
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:10,280
维多利亚
Victoria.

1361
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,570
你不喜欢维多利亚吗
You don't like Victoria?

1362
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:14,130
她的笑声像鬣狗
She laughs like a hyena.

1363
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:15,820
真的吗
Is this true?

1364
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:16,930
不是
No!

1365
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:21,600
有一点像吧  告诉他们你做了什么
Sort of. Yeah, a little bit. But, tell them what you did.

1366
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,490
-爸爸  -跟他们说说电台节目的事
- Dad... - Tell them about the radio show.

1367
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:24,160
-说吧  -爸爸
- Go ahead. - Dad...

1368
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,910
他们想听  说吧  告诉他们
They wanna hear it. Go ahead. Tell them. Tell them.

1369
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:29,830
平安夜那晚  他给一个电台热线节目打电话
Christmas Eve, he phones in one of those radio call-in shows.

1370
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:33,130
说我需要一个新妻子
And tells them I need a new wife.

1371
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:34,960
开玩笑吧
Oh, you're kidding.

1372
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,760
真体贴
That's so sweet.

1373
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,800
现在他对一个给我写信的女人着了迷
Now he's obsessed with this one woman who wrote me.

1374
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,090
-没开玩笑吧  -真的
- Are you serious? - Yeah.

1375
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:44,060
她想和我在帝国大厦的楼顶见面
She wants to meet me at the top of Empire State Building.

1376
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:46,380
在情人节当天
On Valentine's Day.

1377
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:49,520
-就像那部电影一样  -什么电影
- It's like that movie. - What movie?

1378
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,050
《金玉盟》  你们没看过吗
An Affair to Remember. Did you ever see it?

1379
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,540
天哪
Oh, God.

1380
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,500
加里·格兰特和黛博拉·蔻儿主演
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.

1381
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:57,990
是卡尔还是蔻儿
Is that "Karr" Or "Kerr"?

1382
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:58,970
-蔻儿  -卡尔
- Kerr. - Karr.

1383
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:00,430
好吧
Okay.

1384
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,730
她本来会在帝国大厦的楼顶和他见面
She's gonna meet him at the top of the Empire State Building.

1385
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:06,270
但她被出租车撞到了
Only she got hit by a taxi.

1386
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:10,990
他一直在等  我记得好像还在下雨
And he waited and waited. And it was raining, I think.

1387
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:17,730
她因为自尊心  不愿意告诉他...
And then she's too proud to tell him that she's...

1388
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,610
自己瘸了
crippled.

1389
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:26,130
他也因为自尊心  不愿意去探究她没来的原因
And he's too proud to find out why she doesn't come.

1390
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,950
但他最终还是去见她了
But he comes to see her anyway.

1391
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:30,130
我忘了原因  不过
And I forget why, but...

1392
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:34,360
他去见她时的那一幕太感人了
Oh, it's so amazing when he comes to see her.

1393
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,320
因为他都没有注意到
Because he doesn't even notice

1394
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,900
她没有起身和他打招呼
that she doesn't get up to say hello.

1395
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,430
他极尽挖苦与讽刺
And he's very bitter.

1396
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:45,520
你以为他会直接
And you think that he's just gonna

1397
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:47,500
走出那扇门
walk out the door

1398
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,580
永远不知道她为什么没来
and never know why.

1399
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:51,250
她就躺在那里
She's just lying there, you know.

1400
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,960
躺在沙发上
Like, on the couch with

1401
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:57,280
把一条小毯子盖在她萎缩的双腿上
this little blanket over her shrivelled little legs.

1402
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,700
然后
And...

1403
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:00,640
你没事吧
Are you all right?

1404
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:01,550
她没事
She's fine.

1405
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:05,930
突然  他说  "我看到了那幅画"
And suddenly, he goes, "I saw the painting"

1406
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:08,920
然后他走进了卧室
And he, like, goes to the bedroom.

1407
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,520
环顾四周  再走出卧室看着她
And he looks, and he comes out and looks at her.

1408
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,100
然后他就...
And he kind of just...

1409
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:17,050
他们解开了误会  相拥在一起  太感人了
They know and hug and it's so...

1410
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:19,000
这是女人看的电影
That's a chick's movie.

1411
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:21,010
我也这么想
I would say so.

1412
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:23,150
什么样的人
What kind of a person would

1413
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,610
会给电台节目里听到的人写信
write to someone they heard on the radio?

1414
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:27,740
全国上下有成百上千个女人都给我寄了信
I got hundreds of letters from women all over the country.

1415
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:29,110
饥不择食的女人
Desperate women.

1416
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,580
那些女人只是想找个好男人
Just because someone is looking for a nice guy,

1417
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:32,660
这并不代表她们就饥不择食
it doesn't make them desperate.

1418
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,420
「贪婪而缺爱」  这个说法如何
How about rapacious and love-starved?

1419
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:35,120
不行
No.

1420
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:37,880
被恐怖分子杀死的几率都比在四十岁之后
It's easier to be killed by a terrorist than to find a husband

1421
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,380
-找到丈夫的几率大  -根本不是这样
- after the age of 40... - That is absolutely untrue!

1422
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,450
好吧  亲爱的  好吧
Right, honey. Right.

1423
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:45,300
我又不是要找一个邮购新娘
Well, I'm not looking for a mail-order bride.

1424
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,120
我只想找一个
I just want somebody

1425
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:49,220
能和我在吃晚饭时好好聊天的女人
that I can have a decent conversation with over dinner.

1426
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:50,600
不会因为刚看过的电影
You know, without it falling down

1427
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,810
就哭得稀里哗啦的那种女人
into weepy tears over some movie that she just saw.

1428
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:54,480
她太多愁善感了
She's very emotional.

1429
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,600
-不过看到《十二金刚》结尾时  我也哭了  -谁不哭呢
- Although, I cried at the end of The Dirty Dozen. - Who didn't?

1430
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:00,320
吉姆·布朗正往那些通风井里面扔手榴弹
Jim Brown was throwing these hand grenades down these air shafts.

1431
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,030
然后理查德·杰克尔和李·马文
And Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin

1432
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:05,110
坐在装甲运兵车顶上
were sitting on top of this armoured personnel carrier.

1433
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:07,690
他们打扮成纳粹的样子  还有...
They were dressed up like Nazis. And it was...

1434
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,230
-秦尼·罗柏斯  -秦尼·罗柏斯
- Trini Lopez... - Trini Lopez...

1435
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:12,330
在他们空降纳粹敌后区的时候
He busted his neck when they were

1436
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:14,120
他被打中了脖子
parachuting down behind the Nazi lines.

1437
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,710
别说了
Stop it!

1438
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:17,250
理查德·杰克尔  在电影开始的时候
Richard Jaeckel, at the beginning,

1439
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:20,250
戴着一个亮闪闪的钢盔  因为他是宪兵
he had on a shiny helmet, because he was an MP.

1440
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:24,700
别说了  天哪  我爱那部电影
Please, no more. God, I love that movie.

1441
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:36,230
这是我看过的最好的电影了
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.

1442
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:38,100
哪里好了
What's so great about it?

1443
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:40,730
你得找到她  乔纳  你得去见她
You have to find her, Jonah. You have to go to her.

1444
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:43,530
你知道去纽约要花多少钱吗
Do you know how much money it costs to go to New York?

1445
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:44,850
没人知道
Nobody knows.

1446
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:47,480
价格基本每天都在变
It changes practically every day.

1447
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:49,570
你有多少钱
How much money do you have?

1448
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,160
80块
80 dollars.

1449
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:54,370
我有42块  应该够乘出租车了
I have 42. That'll probably cover taxi cabs.

1450
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:56,110
但我要怎么过去呢
But how would I get there?

1451
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:59,210
亲爱的  我得去给别人送票
Honey, I have to run these tickets over to someone.

1452
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:01,610
在我回来之前  帮我看一下家好吗
Can you keep an eye on things out front till I get back?

1453
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:02,590
好的  妈妈
Sure, Mum.

1454
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:14,220
{\an9}鲍德温
93年2月14号
西雅图机场  至  纽约肯尼迪机场
联合航空  班次FL1597

1455
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,360
-你要靠窗的座位还是靠过道的座位  -靠窗
- You want a window seat or aisle? - Window.

1456
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:19,970
-你想要水果拼盘吗  -不知道  我会想要吗
- You want a fruit plate? - I don't know. Do I?

1457
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:22,250
我宁死也不要吃飞机上的食物
I'd rather die than eat airplane food.

1458
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,260
我会告知航空公司你已满十二岁
I'm telling them you're 12

1459
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,530
这样你就可以单独搭乘飞机
so you can fly unaccompanied

1460
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:26,790
那些空姐也不会围着你烦个不停了
and the stewardess won't carry you around and stuff like that.

1461
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:29,650
你疯了吧  谁会相信我满12岁了
Are you crazy? Who'd believe I'm 12?

1462
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:32,420
如果电脑上有记录  他们什么都会信
If it's in the computer, they'll believe anything.

1463
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:33,800
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1464
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,180
你希望我告知他们
Do you want me to say

1465
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:36,780
和同龄人相比  你身材非常矮小
that you're really, really short for your age,

1466
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:37,860
他们不该对此说什么
and they shouldn't say anything

1467
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,350
因为这样会伤害你的感情吗
because it would hurt your feelings?

1468
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:41,410
好  这主意真不错
Yeah. That's a great idea!

你要错过那班火车了  
You're gonna miss the train.

1473
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,720
不  我不会
No, I'm not.

1474

我好高兴  贝琪
I'm so happy, Becky.

1475
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,120
我终于高兴了
Finally, I feel happy.

1476
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:11,150
这样才对  这才是我的现实生活
This is right. This is real.

1477
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:13,950
其他事都是因为我看了太多电影
Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies.

1478
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:16,290
从而完全忽视了真正重要的东西
And you completely lose sight of what counts.

1479

请不要告诉别人发生了什么
Please, don't tell anybody what happened.

哪怕他们只知道一点点
if anyone knew I did anything

1482
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:24,780
我都会羞愧难当
even remotely close to what I have done.

1483
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,470
谢谢  谢谢  你保证吗

Okay. Well, I was just gonna say that ever since Christmas...

1493
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:15,050
你有点变了  有些心不在焉  和我也有些疏远了
you've been different, kind of distracted, distant.

1494
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:20,230
但现在  我感觉你
But now it feels as if you're coming back from

1495
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,400
变回了原来的自己
wherever you were.

1496
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:23,560
是的
I am.

1497
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:27,230
我只是...
I was just...

1498
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:32,180
我只是  我觉得是我紧张了
I just... I just got... I think I got nervous.

1499
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:34,900
但这很正常  对吗
But that's normal, right?

1500
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,760
难道你没有为那件事紧张过吗
I mean, don't you ever feel nervous about... you know?

1501
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:41,340
什么事
What?

1502
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:44,540
永恒
Forever.

1503
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,530
没有
No.

1504
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:52,440
好吧
Well...

1505
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:54,630
我紧张了
I did.

1506
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:57,350
你知道我是怎么想的吗
And... You know what I think?

1507
01:21:57,350 --> 01:22:01,810
我感觉我们太般配了
I think I thought it was too perfect, you know.

1508
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:05,230
我开始怀疑我们会不会
I started to wonder if we were the human equivalent

1509
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:07,310
正正得负
of two rights making a wrong.

1510
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:09,280
你知道那是什么感觉吗
You know what it was?

1511
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,530
感觉就像命运  但也不是
It was like kismet, but not,

1512
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:13,130
不知你明不明白我的意思
if you see what I mean.

1513
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:15,940
你必须得长大
You have to grow up.

1514
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,080
不能再继续抱有
You just can't keep having

1515
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,620
那些青少年般的幻象
all these adolescent fantasies about...

1516
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,430
比如自己今后的生活会有多刺激
how exciting life is gonna be.

1517
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:24,060
别怪我  但我喜欢这花色
Don't hate me, but I love this pattern.

1518
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:26,070
-不会吧  -真的
- You couldn't. - I do.

1519
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:29,150
这和我外婆的瓷器一模一样
This is just like my grandmother's china.

1520
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:31,330
你们要几套餐具
How many place settings should I put down.

1521
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:32,820
-十套  -十套
- Ten. - Ten.

1522
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:40,280
没错  八套太少  十二套又...
Exactly. Eight is too few, twelve is...

1523
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:41,930
太多
Too many.

1524
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,440
沃尔特
Walter.

1525
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:08,690
这曾是我母亲的戒指
It was my mother's.

1526
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:12,830
我让人把尺寸改小了
I had them size it down.

1527
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,960
她的手指很粗
She had really fat fingers.

1528
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:20,720
真好看
It's so beautiful.

1529
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:23,910
如果全世界的戒指
It's exactly what I would pick out if I had

1530
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:27,300
都可供我挑选  我还是会选这一枚
every ring in the whole world to choose from.

1531
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,240
你明白我的意思了吗
You see what I mean?

1532
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:34,980
有的人喜欢恋爱中充满惊喜
There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises,

1533
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,750
但我不是那种人 
but I am not one of those people.

1534
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,880
我不是
No, siree.

1535
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:42,210
人们过分看重了惊喜
Surprises are highly overrated.

1536
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,870
我明天一早就走
I'm leaving first thing in the morning,

1537
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:48,630
但我只会去一个晚上
but I'm only gonna be gone one night.

1538
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:49,860
克拉丽丝会来
Clarise is gonna be here.

1539
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:51,200
你们可以一起看很多
So you'll be able to see plenty of

1540
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:54,300
《格尔拉多》和《猛鬼街》  我不会知道的
Geraldo and Nightmare on Elm Street 12. I will never know.

1541
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:55,690
你要和她一起去吗
Are you going with her?

1542
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,640
我要和维多利亚一起去  没错
I'm going with Victoria, yes.

1543
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:04,400
别想耍花招  明白吗
Don't try anything tricky. Understand?

1544
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:11,200
别等我一出门就去毒藤丛里打滚
Don't go rolling in poison ivy as soon as I leave the house.

1545
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,670
也不要把自己锁在柜子里
Or lock yourself in the closet

1546
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:14,220
或者让自己受伤
or do anything that makes you need stitches.

1547
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:16,400
如果你的手指断了  就会一直断着
If your finger falls off, it's staying off.

1548
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,770
没人会帮你把断指冰敷  然后送你去医院
No one's gonna pack it on ice and take you to hospital,

1549
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:21,130
好让你成为激光手术的医学奇迹
so that you can be a breakthrough in laser surgery.

1550
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:24,200
是因为巴尔的摩的那个女人吗
Is this about that woman in Baltimore?

1551
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:25,410
她叫安妮
Annie.

1552
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:32,270
-我才不在乎你会干什么  -很好
- I don't care what you do! - Good! Fine!

1553
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:34,020
告诉你我这周末会干什么
I'll tell you what I'm doing this weekend.

1554
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:35,200
我要享受性生活
I'm getting laid.

1555
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,620
进入90年代  却没人有性生活了
1990s and nobody's getting laid.

1556
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:40,360
我是全美国这周末唯一有性生活的男人
I'm the only man in the America who's getting laid this weekend.

1557
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,220
我的性生活经历可不多
And I haven't been laid that much.

1558
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:44,670
大学里有过六个女孩  也许是七个
Six girls in college. Maybe seven.

1559
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:47,360
你站在那里多久了
How long have you been there?

1560
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:48,930
一直站着呢
Forever.

1561
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:50,220
你听到我说什么了
What did you hear me just say?

1562
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:52,700
"大学里有过六个女孩  也许是七个"
"Six girls in college. Maybe seven."

1563
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,730
七个  八个  还有玛丽·凯利
Seven. Eight! Mary Kelly.

1564
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,630
我就喜欢她
This is the one I like.

1565
01:25:00,090 --> 01:25:03,880
乔纳  事实上  你不会喜欢上任何女人
Jonah, the fact is, you're not gonna like any woman,

1566
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,450
因为她们不是你妈妈
because it isn't your mother.

1567
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:06,720
你怎么知道
How do you know?

1568
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:11,090
-安妮哪里不好了  -乔纳  闭嘴
- What's wrong with Annie? - Oh, Jonah, shut up!

1569
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:15,390
闭嘴  闭嘴  妈妈从来没对我说过闭嘴
Shut up? Shut up? Mum never said shut up to me.

1570
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,850
妈妈从来不对我大吼大叫
Mum never yelled at me.

1571
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:19,990
-谈话到此结束  -我们为什么不能去纽约
- This conversation is finished. - Why can't we go to New York?

1572
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,830
我们不可能乘上飞机
There is no way that we are going on a plane

1573
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:25,380
去见一个可能是疯子的女人
to meet some woman who could be a crazy, sick lunatic.

1574
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,750
难道你没看过《致命诱惑》吗 
Didn't you see Fatal Attraction?

1575
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,120
你不让我看
You wouldn't let me.

1576
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,630
我看过  那电影把我吓死了
Well, I saw it! And it scared the shit out of me.

1577
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:33,090
把全美国所有的男人都吓死了
It scared the shit out of every man in America!

1578
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:37,160
你不同意  我就不走
I'm not leaving till you say yes.

1579
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:44,840
我恨你  我恨你  我恨你
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!

1580
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:47,400
很好  你可以好好和奥普拉说说[著名脱口秀主持人]That's good! You'll have a lot to tell Oprah

1581
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:48,840
你爸爸是怎么毁了你的一生
how your dad destroyed your life

1582
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,880
就因为他要享受一个特别的周末
because he had to go off for a weekend special

1583
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,700
去假日旅馆享受
at the Holiday Inn!

1584
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:11,290
乔纳  克拉丽丝来了  我得走了
Jonah, Clarise is here and I've got to go.

1585
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:14,680
乔纳

1586
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:19,030
乔纳

乔纳
Jonah.

1589
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,690
乔纳

1590
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:40,710

01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,030
乔纳
Jonah.

1592
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,110
乔纳
Jonah.

1593
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:57,910
杰西卡  亲爱的  你得告诉我们他在哪
Jessica, honey. You have tell us where he is.

1594
01:26:57,910 --> 01:27:00,200
乔纳的爸爸很着急
Jonah's daddy is very upset.

1595
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:02,610
杰西卡  我是你爸爸

1596

"没门"

1599
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,340
"没门"的缩写是MM

1608
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,260

1609
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,260
帝国大厦
Empire State Building.

1610
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:03,550
下次别站得离路边这么近
Get a little further away from the curb next time, mac.

1611
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:04,430

1612

到了
There it is.

1613
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:11,830
你要上去干什么  从楼顶往下吐口水吗
What are you going to do up there? Spit off the top?

1614
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:12,570
不
No,

1615
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,270
我要去见我的新妈妈
I'm going to meet my new mother.

1616
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:23,030
{\an8}前往观景台

1617
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:32,490
{\an8}帝国大厦

1618
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,250
打扰了  我是乔纳  你是安妮吗
Excuse me. I'm Jonah. Are you Annie?

1619

不  我是辛西娅
No, I'm Cynthia.

1620
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:50,190
打扰了  你是安妮吗
Excuse me, are you Annie?

1621
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,410
桌子的位置很不错  谢谢

1622
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,200
有什么问题吗
Is something wrong?

1623
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,730
要来点喝的吗
Can I get you a drink?

1624
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,020
要香槟吗
Some champagne?

1625
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,820
好的  好的
Fine. Fine.

1626
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:46,650
能给我们上一瓶多姆·德路易斯[演员]吗
Can we have a bottle of Dom DeLuise.

1627
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:51,210
-开玩笑的  -这是个笑话
- Just kidding. - It was a joke.

1628
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:54,080
-他指的是唐培里侬香槟王  -知道了
- He meant Dom Perignon. - I got it.

1629
01:29:57,730 --> 01:29:59,220
景色真美  不是吗
Beautiful view, isn't it.

1630
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:01,120
沃尔特
Walter...

1631
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:05,030
有些话我必须告诉你
There's something I have to tell you.

1632
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:21,690
抱歉  我有急事
Hey! Sorry, I have an emergency.

1633
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:25,240
钱  钱  钱  看到了吗
Money, money, money, see?

1634
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:46,790
所以他现在可能在帝国大厦楼顶
So he could be on top of the Empire State Building now?

1635
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:48,410
不
No.

1636
01:31:49,210 --> 01:31:50,700
我想可能会吧
I guess he could be.

1637
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,330
不
No.

1638
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:56,340
和他无关  沃尔特  是我的原因
It's not him, Walter. It's me.

1639
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:59,810
我做不到
I can't do this.

1640
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:05,760
安妮  我爱你
Look, Annie, I love you.

1641
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:08,140
但先别扯这个吧
But let's leave that out of this.

1642
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:12,230
我不希望成为你将就的对象
I don't want to be someone that you're settling for.

1643
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:16,410
我不希望成为任何人将就的对象
I don't want to be someone that anyone settles for.

1644
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:19,500
婚姻本身就已经足够艰难
Marriage is hard enough

1645
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,900
更不用说在期望如此之低的情况下
without bringing such low expectations into it.

1646
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:24,830
不是吗
Isn't it?

1647
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,080
沃尔特  我配不上你
Walter, I don't deserve you.

1648
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:31,470
不  我觉得这么说不合适
No, I wouldn't put it that way.

1649
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:35,260
不过  我接受
But...okay.

1650
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:52,880
你没事吗
You okay?

1651
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:54,980
没事
Yeah.

1652
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:03,040
-怎么了  -看
- What? - Look.

1653
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:13,200
这是个预兆
It's a sign.

1654
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:15,020
谁需要预兆
Who needed a sign?

1655
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,240
沃尔特
Walter,

1656
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:19,730
我得走了
I have to go.

1657
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:34,140
乔纳
Jonah!

1658
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:37,560
乔纳
Jonah!

1659
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:41,120
-爸  爸  -乔纳
- Dad! Dad! - Jonah?

1660
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,370
如果你出事了怎么办
What if something happened to you?

1661
01:33:57,620 --> 01:33:59,590
如果我找不到你怎么办
What if I couldn't get to you?

1662
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,080
对不起  对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1663
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:06,080
那我该怎么办
What would I have done?

1664
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:10,150
你是我的家人  是我的一切
You are my family. You're all I've got.

1665
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:12,390
我以为她会在这  我以为她会来
I thought she'd be here. I thought she'd come.

1666
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:14,480
我们过得挺好的  不是吗  我们挺好的吧
We're doing okay, aren't we? I mean, are we okay?

1667
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,120
我们不是过得挺好的吗 
Aren't we all right?

1668
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,380
到目前为止  我做过蠢事吗
So far, have I done anything really stupid?

1669
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:18,360
没有
No.

1670
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:20,220
我有没有毁了我们的生活
Have I screwed it up for the both of us?

1671
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:21,240
没有
No.

1672
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:06,300
{\an8}帝国大厦

1673
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:17,230
-能去观景台吗  -抱歉  女士  已经太晚了
- Observation deck? - Sorry, ma'am, but it's too late.

1674
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:21,100
不  求求你  我真的得上去
No, please. I really need to get up there.

1675
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:23,120
我们要关门了  今晚不搭客了
We're closing up. No more runs tonight.

1676
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:30,440
听我说
Listen...

1677
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:35,200
我能去看一眼吗  我本该和一个人在上面见面
Can I just take a look? There's someone I was supposed to meet.

1678
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,450
他很可能不在
He's probably not there,

1679
01:35:36,450 --> 01:35:39,790
但我要是不看一眼  我永远都不会甘心
but if I don't at least look, I'll always wonder about it.

1680
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:42,180
加里·格兰特  对吗
Cary Grant, right?

1681
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:43,790
你知道那部电影
You know that movie?

1682
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:46,670
我妻子的最爱之一
It's one of my wife's favourites.

1683
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:58,740
也许等我们回家之后  我们可以养条狗
Maybe when we get home, we'll get a dog.

1684
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,370
好吧
Okay.

1685
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:01,940
"好吧"是什么意思
What do you mean, okay?

1686
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:03,660
你不想养狗吗
Wouldn't you like to have a dog?

1687
01:36:04,330 --> 01:36:05,660
当然想
Sure.

1688
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:20,950
抱歉  女士  空无一人
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

1689
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:24,890
能让我待一会吗
Can I take a minute?

1690
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:27,840
去吧
Go ahead.

1691
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:43,870
我把包落在望远镜旁了
I left it by the telescopes.

1692
01:38:10,910 --> 01:38:12,970
-是你  -是我
- It's you. - It's me.

1693
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,550
我在马路上见过你
I saw you in the street.

1694
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:17,180
你是安妮吗
Are you Annie?

1695
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:20,780
没错
Yes.

1696
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:25,150
你就是安妮
You're Annie?

1697
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,680
这肯定是你的熊
This must be yours.
